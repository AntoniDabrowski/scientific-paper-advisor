1394,"3 Systemic Risk Measure on Overlapping Groups

To further study the systemic risk measure under exponential utility functions, we generalize the

systemic risk allocation for N individuals on disjoint groups in section 2 to the risk allocation for

them on overlapping groups where they can choose multiple groups to allocate their risks.","It is impossible for individuals to stay with correlated
and uncorrelated individuals at the same time except for the trivial case when all individuals are
together.","Assuming

there are at most h groups, the weighted risk factors for the nth-individual assigned to multiple

groups are labelled as wn,kXn, k = 1, .",2022-02-01 18:56:47+00:00,Systemic Risk Models for Disjoint and Overlapping Groups with Equilibrium Strategies,q-fin.MF,"['q-fin.MF', 'q-fin.RM', '60A99, 91A06, 91B50, 91G99']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Yichen Feng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jean-Pierre Fouque'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ruimeng Hu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tomoyuki Ichiba')]","We analyze the systemic risk for disjoint and overlapping groups (e.g.,

Stochastics, 24(2020), 513--564] by allowing individual banks to choose their
preferred groups instead of being assigned to certain groups. We introduce the
concept of Nash equilibrium for these new models, and analyze the optimal
solution under Gaussian distribution of the risk factor. We also provide an
explicit solution for the risk allocation of the individual banks, and study
the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium both theoretically and
numerically. The developed numerical algorithm can simulate scenarios of
equilibrium, and we apply it to study the bank-CCP structure with real data and
show the validity of the proposed model.",0.3222964,0.46666548,-0.3024578,A

proportional transaction costs depending on the transaction volume. The retiree
dynamically controls the allocation policy between the two accounts and the
consumption policy to maximize the consumption and bequest utilities. We
formulate the optimization problem as a combined stochastic and impulse control
problem with infinite time horizon, and characterize the value function as the
unique viscosity solution of a HJBQVI (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmen
quasi-variational inequality). The numerical results exhibit the V-shaped
transaction region which consists of two stages. In the former stage, since
longevity credits increase gradually, the retiree decreases the proportion of
wealth in the tontine account to smooth the wealth and reduce the volatility.
However, in the latter stage, the retiree increases the proportion of wealth in
the tontine account to gamble for the considerable longevity credits.",0.32480824,0.27199748,-0.46705222,A_centroid
