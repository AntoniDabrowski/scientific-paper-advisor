gene transcription and translation, have been shown to play an important role
in cellular dynamics. Time delays, motivated by the gene expression process,
can also greatly affect the behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems. In this
dissertation, we explore their effects on Turing pattern mechanisms. By
incorporating time delays, modelled as both a fixed parameter and as a
continuous distribution, into classical reaction-diffusion systems that exhibit
Turing instabilities, we investigate the changing behaviour of these systems.
We find that an introduction of increasing time delay increases the time taken
for spatially inhomogeneous patterns to stabilise, and the two are related
linearly. We also present results to show, through a linear stability analysis,
that an increasing time delay can act both to expand or shrink the Turing space
of a certain reaction-diffusion mechanism, depending on the placement of
time-delayed terms. Significantly, we find that modelling time delays as a
continuous distribution has a negligible impact on qualitative or quantitative
aspects of the results seen compared with a fixed time delay of the mean of the
distribution. These findings serve to highlight the importance of considering
gene expression time delays when modelling biological patterning events, as
well as requiring a complete understanding of the cellular dynamics before
attempting to apply Turing mechanisms to explain biological phenomena. The
results also suggest, at least for the distributions considered in this
dissertation, that fixed delay and distributed delay models have almost
identical dynamics. This allows one to use simpler fixed delay models rather
than the more complicated distributed delay variants.",0.48150456,-0.33858043,-0.23579891,C

unicellular to multicellular organisms. Volvocine algae are models for this
transition, as they span from the unicellular biflagellate Chlamydomonas to
multicellular species of Volvox with up to 50,000 Chlamydomonas-like cells on
the surface of a spherical extracellular matrix. The mechanism of phototaxis in
these species is of particular interest since they lack a nervous system and
intercellular connections; steering is a consequence of the response of
individual cells to light. Studies of Volvox and Gonium, a 16-cell organism
with a plate-like structure, have shown that the flagellar response to changing
illumination of the cellular photosensor is adaptive, with a recovery time
tuned to the rotation period of the colony around its primary axis. Here,
combining high-resolution studies of the flagellar photoresponse with 3D
tracking of freely-swimming cells, we show that such tuning also underlies
phototaxis of Chlamydomonas. A mathematical model is developed based on the
rotations around an axis perpendicular to the flagellar beat plane that occur
through the adaptive response to oscillating light levels as the organism
spins. Exploiting a separation of time scales between the flagellar
photoresponse and phototurning, we develop an equation of motion that
accurately describes the observed photoalignment. In showing that the adaptive
time scale is tuned to the organisms' rotational period across three orders of
magnitude in cell number, our results suggest a unified picture of phototaxis
in green algae in which the asymmetry in torques that produce phototurns arise
from the individual flagella of Chlamydomonas, the flagellated edges of Gonium
and the flagellated hemispheres of Volvox.",0.522594,-0.3475697,0.10188616,C_centroid

S. Bagdassarian'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. P. Etchells'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. S. Savage')]","The cambium is a meristematic tissue in plant stems. Here, cell divisions
occur that are required for radial growth of plant stems. Daughters of cell
divisions within the cambium differentiate into woody xylem cells towards the
inside of the stem, or phloem towards the outside. As such, a pattern of
xylem-cambium-phloem is present along the radial axis of the stem. A
ligand-receptor pair, TDIF-PXY promotes cell division in the cambium, as do the
phytohormones, cytokinin and auxin. An auxin response factor, MP, has been
proposed to initiate cambial cell divisions by promoting PXY expression,
however, MP has also been reported to repress cambial cell divisions later in
development where TDIF-PXY complexes are also reported to suppress MP activity.
Here, we used a mathematical modelling approach to investigate how MP cell
division-promoting activity and cell division-repressing activity might be
integrated into the same network as a negative feedback loop. In our model,
this feedback loop improved the ability of the cambium to pattern correctly and
was found to be required for normal patterning when MP was stable. The
implications of this model in early and late cambium development are discussed.",0.34586784,-0.13480437,0.11512659,C
