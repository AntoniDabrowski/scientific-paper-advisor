to interatomic/intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) and/or electron transfer
mediated decay (ETMD) mechanisms. A few of the numerous variables that can
impact these non-radiative decay mechanisms include bond distance, the number
of nearby atoms or molecules, and the polarisation effect. In this paper, we
have studied the effect of protonation and deprotonation on the ionization
potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP), and lifetime (or decay
width) of the temporary bound state in these non-radiative decay processes. We
have chosen LiH-NH$_3$ and LiH-H$_2$O as test systems. The equation of motion
coupled cluster singles and doubles method augmented by complex absorbing
potential (CAP-EOM-CCSD) has been used in calculating the energetic position of
the decaying state and the system's decay rate. Deprotonation of
LiH-NH$_3$/LiH-H$_2$O either from the metal center (LiH) or from ammonia/water
lowers the IP and DIP compared to the neutral systems. In contrast, protonation
increases these quantities compared to neutral systems. The protonation closes
the inner valence state relaxation channels for ICD/ETMD. For example, the
decay of the O-2s/N-2s state stops in protonated systems (LiH$_2^+$-H$_2$O,
LiH$_2^+$-NH$_3$, and LiH-NH$_4^+$). Our study also shows that the efficiency,
i.e., the rate of ICD/ETMD, can be altered by protonation and deprotonation. It
is expected to have implications for chemical and biological systems",0.007538326,0.12432732,-0.2169036,B

reactive vortex in the configuration-time space, where the highest probability
peak and the transition state ensemble are located. This reactive region
contains strong rotational fluxes: Most reactive trajectories swirl multiple
times around this region in the subspace of the two most-important reaction
