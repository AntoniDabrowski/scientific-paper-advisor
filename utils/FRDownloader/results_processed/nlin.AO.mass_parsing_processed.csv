activity generically arise in many contexts including neuron firing, social
contagions, epidemics, and critical infrastructure failures. These phenomena
are in direct competition and represent a frustration between the network's
geometry and topology. Here, we extend their study to systems with higher-order
interactions by analyzing cascades over noisy geometric complexes, which
contain short- and long-range `simplices' that encode dyadic, triadic, and
high-order dependencies. We present a simplicial threshold model (STM) for
cascades in which a vertex $v_i$ becomes active only when the activity across
its simplicial neighbors -- including adjacent 1-simplices, 2-simplices, etc.
-- surpasses a threshold $T_i$. We show that higher-order interactions and
thresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades along a geometric
substrate comprised of lower-adjacent simplices despite the presence of
long-range simplices. We explore this phenomenon for a simplicial-complex-based
model of a neuronal network, i.e., a neuronal complex, revealing that
higher-order interactions also promote the expressiveness and efficiency of
diverse spatio-temporal patterns. We support these findings with bifurcation
theory to predict wavefront and clustering dynamics as well as introduce
simplicial cascade maps that embed simplicial complexes with a latent geometry
in which pairwise distances reflect the time required for STM cascades to
travel between vertices. Our findings and proposed mathematical tools reveal
the dynamical/structural interplay of higher-order nonlinearity and the
multidimensional geometry of simplicial complexes to be a fruitful direction
for uncovering the multiscale mechanisms that orchestrate higher-order
processing within complex systems.",0.61035824,-0.04245431,-0.053208813,C

for nonlinear cascades over simplicial complexes in which dyadic, triadic and
higher-order interactions are represented by $k$-dimensional simplices (i.e.,
$k$-simplices) involving $(k-1)$ vertices/nodes. We study deterministic and
stochastic STM cascades over noisy geometric complexes that contain both short-

as a frustration between local wavefront propagations and non-local appearances
of new clusters of activity. We show that higher-order coupling and nonlinear

geometrical channels, which can benefit the memory capacity and efficiency for
cascades for over simplical-complex-based models of neuro-systems (i.e.,
neuronal complexes). We support these findings with bifurcation theory and a

network restructuring potential, and (3) multi-dimensional optimization
criteria for best fitting mitigation strategies-criteria. Therefore, the

efficient mitigation strategy. To fulfill the purpose of this paper, the
Mitigation Controller (MitC) has been developed using an integrative approach
of non-linear optimization techniques, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation,
and preference function modeling. Compared to the conventional way of
mitigating project delays. The developed MitC allows mitigating potential
delays with the least negative consequences on several project criteria, such
as cost, environmental impact, etc. The application of the model to the
demonstrative case study shows the ability of the model to significantly
increase the probability of completing the project in the given target

a network of memristive Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neurons. The proposed model was
built considering the memristive autapse of the traditional 2D HR neuron. Using
the one-parameter bifurcation diagram and its corresponding maximal Lyapunov
exponent graph, we showed that the proposed model was able to exhibit a reverse
period doubling route to chaos, phenomenon of interior and exterior crises.
Three different configurations of the ring-star network of the memristive HR
neuron model, including ring-star, ring, and star, have been considered. The
study of those network configurations revealed incoherent, coherent, chimera,
and cluster state behaviors. Coherent behavior is characterized by
synchronization of the neurons of the network, while incoherent behaviors are
characterized by the absence of synchronization. Chimera states refer to a
different state where there is a coexistence of synchronized and asynchronized
nodes of the network. One of the interesting results of the paper is the
prevalence of double-well chimera states in both ring and ring-star network
