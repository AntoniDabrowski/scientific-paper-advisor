based on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) at partially and strongly
quantum degenerate regimes. It is demonstrated that the KS-DFT calculations are
able to accurately reproduce the available path integral Monte Carlo simulation
results at temperatures relevant for warm dense matter research. The existing
analytical results for the quadratic and cubic response functions are
rigorously tested. It is demonstrated that the analytical results for the
quadratic response function closely agree with the KS-DFT data. Furthermore,
the performed analysis reveals that currently available analytical formulas for
the cubic response function are not able to describe simulation results,
neither qualitatively nor quantitatively, at small wave-numbers $q<2q_F$, with
$q_F$ being the Fermi wave-number. The results show that KS-DFT can be used to
describe warm dense matter that is strongly perturbed by an external field with
remarkable accuracy. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that KS-DFT constitutes a
valuable tool to guide the development of the non-linear response theory of
correlated quantum electrons from ambient to extreme conditions. This opens up
new avenues to study nonlinear effects in a gamut of different contexts at

created by the collision of two inhomogeneous, asymmetric, weakly magnetised
laser-produced plasma jets can generate strong stochastic magnetic fields via
the small-scale turbulent dynamo mechanism, provided the magnetic Reynolds
number of the plasma is sufficiently large. In this paper, we compare such a
plasma with one arising from two pre-magnetised plasma jets whose creation is
identical save for the addition of a strong external magnetic field imposed by
a pulsed magnetic field generator (`MIFEDS'). We investigate the differences
between the two turbulent systems using a Thomson-scattering diagnostic, X-ray
self-emission imaging and proton radiography. The Thomson-scattering spectra
and X-ray images suggest that the presence of the external magnetic field has a
limited effect on the plasma dynamics in the experiment. While the presence of
the external magnetic field induces collimation of the flows in the colliding
plasma jets and the initial strengths of the magnetic fields arising from the
interaction between the colliding jets are significantly larger as a result of
the external field, the energy and morphology of the stochastic magnetic fields
post-amplification are indistinguishable. We conclude that, for turbulent
laser-plasmas with super-critical magnetic Reynolds numbers, the
dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are determined by the turbulent dynamics

converts magnetic energy into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal
energy, and non-thermal energetic particles, including energetic electrons.
Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms in different low-$\beta$
(plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio) and collisionless environments have been
proposed theoretically and studied numerically, including first- and
second-order Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration, parallel electric field
acceleration along magnetic fields, and direct acceleration by the reconnection
electric field. However, none of them have been heretofore confirmed
experimentally, as the direct observation of non-thermal particle acceleration
in laboratory experiments has been difficult due to short Debye lengths for
\textit{in-situ} measurements and short mean free paths for \textit{ex-situ}
measurements. Here we report the direct measurement of accelerated non-thermal
electrons from low-$\beta$ magnetically driven reconnection in experiments
using a laser-powered capacitor coil platform. We use kiloJoule lasers to drive
parallel currents to reconnect MegaGauss-level magnetic fields in a
quasi-axisymmetric geometry. The angular dependence of the measured electron
energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by
particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that the mechanism of direct electric
field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work.
Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical
observations. Our results therefore validate one of the proposed acceleration
mechanisms by reconnection, and establish a new approach to study reconnection

trajectory in the phase space corresponds to the electron with low (few eV)
initial energy experiencing $\sim$10$^9$ times energy gain. For this to occur,
electron density should be a few percent of the critical density, while the
in-channel electron density should be $\sim$3 times lower. The analytically
obtained dependence of the energy gain on the initial electron longitudinal and
transverse momenta corresponds well to the results of exact numerical

reduced kinetic models and there has been recent progress in involving losses
due to field stochasticity, either via a loss-time parameter or radial
transport coefficients which can be estimated by tracing test electrons in 3D
fields. We evaluate these terms in ITER using a recent JOREK 3D MHD simulation
of plasma disruption to provide the stochastic magnetic fields where RE markers
are traced with the built-in particle tracing module. While the MHD simulation
modelled only the current quench phase, the case is MHD unstable and exhibits
similar relaxation as would be expected during the thermal quench. Therefore,
the RE simulations can be considered beginning right after the thermal quench
but before the MHD relaxation is complete. The plasma is found to become fully
stochastic for 8 ms and the resulting transport is sufficient to overcome RE
avalanche before flux surfaces are reformed. We also study transport mechanisms

Yet, in a collisionless plasma, an external magnetic field can sustain a stable

of the plasma through the shock front, allowing to self-consistently compute
the downstream anisotropy, hence the density jump, in terms of the upstream
parameters. This model dealt with the case of a parallel shock, where the
magnetic field is normal to the front both in the upstream and the downstream.
Yet, MHD also allows for shock solutions, the so-called switch-on solutions,
where the field is normal to the front only in the upstream. This article
consists in applying our model to these switch-on shocks. While MHD offers only
1 switch-on solution within a limited range of Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers, our
model offers 2 kinds of solutions within a slightly different range of
Alfv\'{e}n Mach numbers. These 2 solutions are most likely the outcome of the

efficiency of Shattered Pellet Injection (SPI) as a Disruption Mitigation
System (DMS). Current mainstream 3D MHD codes modelling SPIs mostly assume
instantaneous thermalization between the previously hot ambient electrons and
the newly released cold electrons, which results in underestimation of the
ablation rate if the hot electron thermalization time is comparable or even
longer than the fragment flying time. To resolve this doubt, we hereby
investigate the thermalization dynamics and the overall hot-electron impact.
The finite-time collisional thermalization of hot-tail electrons in a rapidly
cooling plasma, as well as the so-called ``self-limiting'' effect are
considered. The former effect tends to deplete the colder population within a
hot-tail species, while the latter is found to preferentially deplete the
higher energy population. The combined result is found to cause an almost
self-similar decay of the hot electron distribution function, while its shape
does not deviate much from that of Maxwellian distribution and the mean energy
does not change much during the thermalization process. Based on this
observation, axisymmetric JOREK D2 SPI simulations were carried out with
additional hot-tail contribution to evaluate their overall impact onto the
injection assimilation and penetration. It is found that the hot-tail effect
indeed causes enhanced assimilation and shallower penetration, although the
overall effect depends on the exact injection configuration, with the slow
injection showing negligible hot-tail effect while the fast single
non-shattered pellet case shows drastic hot-tail ablation enhancement. For
ITER-like SPI parameters, there is no significant deviation in the total
assimilation, but some deviation in the injection penetration is observed for

voltage--for the deconfinement of runaway electrons is modeled for disruption
scenarios in the SPARC and DIII-D tokamaks. Nonlinear MHD modeling is carried
out with the NIMROD code including time-dependent magnetic field boundary
conditions to simulate the effect of the coil. Further modeling in some cases
uses the ASCOT5 code to calculate advection and diffusion coefficients for
runaway electrons based on the NIMROD-calculated fields, and the DREAM code to
compute the runaway evolution in the presence of these transport coefficients.
Compared with similar modeling in Tinguely, et al [2021 Nucl. Fusion 61
124003], considerably more conservative assumptions are made with the ASCOT5
results, zeroing low levels of transport, particularly in regions in which
closed flux surfaces have reformed. Of three coil geometries considered in
SPARC, only the $n=1$ coil is found to have sufficient resonant components to
suppress the runaway current growth. Without the new conservative transport
assumptions, full suppression of the RE current is maintained when the TQ MHD
is included in the simulation or when the RE current is limited to 250kA, but
when transport in closed flux regions is fully suppressed, these scenarios
allow RE beams on the order of 1-2MA to appear. Additional modeling is
performed to consider the effects of the close ideal wall. In DIII-D, the
current quench is modeled for both limited and diverted equilibrium shapes. In
the limited shape, the onset of stochasticity is found to be insensitive to the
coil current amplitude and governed largely by the evolution of the

was proposed, building on work in Brown et al. This model was found to
qualitatively describe changes in wake structure, but consistently over

solid, and liquid targets with the intense x-ray output of free-electron-lasers
(FELs). For gaseous targets lasing relies on the creation of K-shell core-holes
on a time-scale short compared with filling via Auger decay. In the case of
solid and liquid density systems, collisional effects will also be important,
affecting not only populations, but also line-widths, both of which impact the
degree of overall gain, and its duration. However, to date such collisional
effects have not been extensively studied. We present here initial simulations
using the CCFLY code of inner-shell lasing in solid density Mg, where we
self-consistently treat the effects of the incoming FEL radiation and the
atomic kinetics of the Mg system, including radiative, Auger, and collisional
effects. We find that the combination of collisional population of the lower
states of the lasing transitions and broadening of the lines precludes lasing
on all but the K$\alpha$ of the initially cold system. Even assuming
instantaneous turning on of the FEL pump, we find the duration of the gain in
the solid system to be sub-femtosecond.",0.008927848,-0.30299503,-0.14231342,A

for studying many-body interactions associated with various plasma phenomena.
In this paper we discuss an approach that makes possible creation of the
steady-state ultracold plasma having various densities and temperatures by
means of continuous two-step optical excitation of calcium atoms in the MOT.
The parameters of the plasma are studied using laser-induced fluorescence of
calcium ions. The experimental results are well described by a simple
theoretical model involving equilibration of the continuous source of charged
particles by the hydrodynamical ion outflux and three-body recombination. The
strongly coupled plasma with the peak ion density of $6\cdot10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and
the minimum electron temperature near 2 K has been prepared. Our steady-state

Consequently, proton imaging has been used in a wide range of HED experiments,
