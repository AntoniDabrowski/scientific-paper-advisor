algebras and ternary relations as putative examples of ternary categories to be studied in detail in
subsequent work.","Similar to how the class of binary relations on sets serves as a model for the deﬁnition of ordinary

interactions, to algebraic operations, to compositions of processes, to network
models, binary structures are deeply ingrained in the fabric of most current
scientific paradigms. In this article we introduce arity as the generic
conceptualization of the order of an interaction between a discrete collection
of entities and argue that there is a rich universe of higher arity ideas
beyond binarity waiting to be explored. To illustrate this we discuss several
higher order phenomena appearing in a wide range of research areas, paying
special attention to instances of ternary interactions. From the point of view
of formal sciences and mathematics, higher arity thinking opens up new
paradigms of algebra, symbolic calculus and logic. In particular, we delve into
the special case of ternary structures, as that itself reveals ample surprises:
new notions of associativity (or lack thereof) in ternary operations of cubic
matrices, ternary isomorphisms and ternary relations, the integration problem
of 3-Lie algebras, and generalizations of adjacency in 3-uniform hypergraphs.
All these are open problems that strongly suggest the need to develop new
ternary mathematics. Finally, we comment on potential future research
directions and remark on the transdisciplinary nature of higher arity science.",0.10762838,0.1858862,-0.46447897,C

fuzzy logical operators play a key role in the development of FRS theory. In
order to further generalize the FRS theory to more complicated data
environments, we firstly propose four types of fuzzy neighborhood operators
based on fuzzy covering by overlap functions and their implicators in this
paper. Meanwhile, the derived fuzzy coverings from an original fuzzy covering
are defined and the equalities among overlap function-based fuzzy neighborhood
operators based on a finite fuzzy covering are also investigated. Secondly, we
prove that new operators can be divided into seventeen groups according to
equivalence relations, and the partial order relations among these seventeen
classes of operators are discussed, as well. Go further, the comparisons with $
t$-norm-based fuzzy neighborhood operators given by D'eer et al. are also made
and two types of neighborhood-related fuzzy covering-based rough set models,
which are defined via different fuzzy neighborhood operators that are on the
basis of diverse kinds of fuzzy logical operators proposed. Furthermore, the
groupings and partially order relations are also discussed. Finally, a novel

as filter design, pattern recognition, image processing and optics. In order to
obtain a more concise and intuitive convolution form, this paper studies two
kinds of new convolution theorems in the FMT domain. First, based on the
expression of the generalized translation, we derive the convolution theorem of
the first kind in the FMT domain, which has elegance and simplicity comparable
to the classical results of Fourier transform (FT). Second, we again give the
convolution theorem of the second kind in the FMT domain to further study the
diversity of convolution theory. It has the advantage that it can be
represented by a simple integral and is easy to implement in multiplying filter
designs. Finally, based on the simple form of the above convolution theorems,
we discuss multiplicative filters in the MFT domain.",0.02898501,0.69315505,-0.19726253,C
