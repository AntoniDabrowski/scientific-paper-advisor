locally irreducible in every bipartition, which shows the phenomenon of strong
quantum nonlocality without entanglement. It is known that unextendible product
bases (UPBs) can show the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality without
entanglement. Thus it is interesting to investigate the strong quantum
nonlocality for UPBs. Most of the UPBs with the minimum size cannot demonstrate
strong quantum nonlocality. In this paper, we construct a series of UPBs with
different large sizes in $d_A\otimes d_B\otimes d_C$ and $d_A\otimes d_B\otimes
d_C\otimes d_D$ for $d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D\geq 3$, and we also show that these
UPBs have strong quantum nonlocality, which answers an open question given by

protocol to locally discriminate the UPB in $3\otimes 3\otimes 4$, and it
consumes less entanglement resource than the teleportation-based protocol. Our

there are many types of problems which, as they grow in size, their
computational complexity grows larger than classical computers will ever be
able to solve. Quantum computing (QC) is a computation model that uses quantum
physical properties to solve such problems. QC is at the early stage of
large-scale adoption in various industry domains to take advantage of the
algorithmic speed-ups it has to offer. It can be applied in a variety of areas,
such as computer science, mathematics, chemical and biochemical engineering,
and the financial industry. The main goal of this paper is to give an overview
to chemical and biochemical researchers and engineers who may not be familiar
with quantum computation. Thus, the paper begins by explaining the fundamental
concepts of QC. The second contribution this publication tries to tackle is the
fact that the chemical engineering literature still lacks a comprehensive
review of the recent advances of QC. Therefore, this article reviews and
summarizes the state of the art to gain insight into how quantum computation
can benefit and optimize chemical engineering issues. A bibliography analysis
covers the comprehensive literature in QC and analyzes quantum computing
research in chemical engineering on various publication topics, using Clarivate
analytics covering the years 1990 to 2020. After the bibliographic analysis,

demonstrate the mitigating effect of the loss on visibility of the SALHI via
asymmetric gain optimization, where the maximum threshold of loss to visibility
close to $100\%$ is increased. Furthermore, we theoretically find that the
optimal condition for the largest visibility is the same as that for the
enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the best value in the presence of
losses using the intensity detection, indicating that the visibility can act as

terms of the influence matrix (IM), which encodes the effects of a many-body
system as an environment for a local subsystem. Recent works found that in many
dynamical regimes the IM of an infinite system has low temporal entanglement
and can be efficiently represented as a matrix-product state (MPS). Yet, direct
iterative constructions of the IM encounter highly entangled intermediate
states - a temporal entanglement barrier (TEB). We argue that TEB is
ubiquitous, and elucidate its physical origin via a semiclassical quasiparticle
picture that captures the exact behavior of integrable spin chains. Further, we
show that a TEB also arises in chaotic spin chains, which lack well-defined
quasiparticles. Based on these insights, we formulate an alternative light-cone
growth algorithm, which provably avoids TEB, thus providing an efficient
construction of the thermodynamic-limit IM as a MPS. This work demonstrates the

non-Markovian processes, the complete measurement on intermediate state will
lead to conflicts. So we use a general measurement for intermediate state,

correlations are reflected in a Markovian property. For Markovian processes, we
can extend the two-point measurement to a three-point measurement and obtain
that the fluctuation theorems contain complete information about the
intermediate state. For non-Markovian processes, the complete measurement of
the intermediate state leads to conflicts. Therefore, we use a general
measurement, which only provides partial information, for the intermediate
state. The corresponding fluctuation theorems show that memory effects can
reduce these fluctuations. This is consistent with the fact that system states
can be recovered under non-Markovian processes.",0.20905101,0.21807507,0.039604183,B

classic application of spoofing is in radar where an airborne target attempts
to avoid being tracked by a ground-based radar by emitting pulses indicating a
false range or velocity. In certain scenarios it has been shown that a sensor
can exploit quantum mechanics to detect spoofing at the single-photon level.
Here we analyze an idealized spoofing scenario where a transmitter-receiver
pair, seeking to detect spoofing, utilizes a signal chosen randomly from a set
of non-orthogonal, coherent states. We show that a spoofer optimally employing
classical information on the state of the transmitted signal (i.e. the best
measure-and-prepare strategy allowed by quantum mechanics) inevitably emits
imperfect spoofs that can be exploited by the receiver to reveal the presence
of the spoofer, or to discriminate between true reflections and spoofs.

statistics in isolated quantum systems has been established in theory and
confirmed via experiment. However, the understanding of several consequential
phenomena, such as the Many-Body Localization (MBL), has been obstructed by the
lack of a systematic approach to obtain many-body entanglement dynamics. This
paper introduces the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) approach to
entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems and employs this new
framework to demonstrate the mechanism of MBL in disordered spin chains. We
show that in the QCTF framework, the entanglement dynamics of two-level
constituent particles of a many-body quantum system can be fully characterized
directly from the system's Hamiltonian, which circumvents the bottleneck of
calculating the many-body system's time-evolution. By employing the QCTF-based
approach to entanglement dynamics, we demonstrate MBL dynamics in disordered
Heisenberg spin chains through the suppressed quasi-periodic spin's
entanglement evolution after a quench from an anti-ferromagnetic state.
Furthermore, we prove the validity of a previous fundamental conjecture
regarding the MBL phase by showing that in strongly-disordered spin chains with
short-range interactions, the quantum correlation between particles is
exponentially attenuated with respect to the site-to-site distance. Moreover,
we obtain the lowest possible amplitude of the quasi-periodic spin's
entanglement as a function of disorder in the chain. The QCTF analysis is
verified by exact numerical simulation of the system's evolution. We also show
that QCTF provides a new foundation to study the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis (ETH). The QCTF methodology can be extended in various ways to

communication that directly transmits information over quantum channel. The
final component of this promising solution is our classical quantum-resistant
algorithm. Explicitly, in these networks, the ciphertext gleaned from a
quantum-resistant algorithm is transmitted using QSDC along the nodes, where it
is read out and then transmitted to the next node. At the repeaters, the
information is protected by our quantum-resistant algorithm, which is secure

end-to-end communication across the entire network, since it is capable of both
eavesdropping detection and prevention in the emerging quantum internet. It is
compatible with operational networks, and will enjoy the compelling services of
the popular Internet, including authentication. Hence, it smoothens the

party's location in spacetime by exploiting constraints on quantum information

involves requiring the prover to redirect a quantum system based on the value
of a Boolean function $f$. Cheating strategies for the $f$-routing scheme
require the prover use pre-shared entanglement, and security of the scheme
rests on assumptions about how much entanglement a prover can manipulate. Here,
we give a new cheating strategy in which the quantum system is encoded into a
secret-sharing scheme, and the authorization structure of the secret-sharing
scheme is exploited to direct the system appropriately. This strategy completes
the $f$-routing task using $O(SP_p(f))$ EPR pairs, where $SP_p(f)$ is the
minimal size of a span program over the field $\mathbb{Z}_p$ computing $f$.
This shows we can efficiently attack $f$-routing schemes whenever $f$ is in the

pre-processing. The best earlier construction achieved the class L, which is

Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with the input states generated by performing
non-Gaussian operations, viz., photon subtraction, photon addition, and photon
catalysis on a two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. Since these non-Gaussian
operations are probabilistic, it is of utmost importance to take the success
probability into account. To this end, we consider the realistic model of
photon subtraction, addition, and catalysis and derive a single expression of
the Wigner function for photon subtracted, added, and catalyzed TMSV state. The
Wigner function is used to evaluate the lower bound on the phase sensitivity
via quantum Cramer-Rao bound and parity detection based phase sensitivity in
MZI. We identify the ranges of squeezing and transmissivity parameters where
the non-Gaussian states provide better phase sensitivity than the TMSV state.
On qualitatively taking the success probability into account, it turns out that
the photon addition is the most advantageous non-Gaussian operation. We hope
that the generalized Wigner function derived in this work will be useful in

capacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and
private key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of
capacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to
obtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states,
such as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further
understand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational
limitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms
of the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state.

studied, where $W$ is an arbitary $2\times 2$ unitary operator. In a previous
paper, a recursive quantum error correction scheme using $k+1$ qubits to
protect $k$ qubits was proposed. In this paper, the error correction scheme is
implemented for 3-qubit and 5-qubit channels on the IBM online quantum
computers using \texttt{qiskit}, and issues arising in implementation are
studied. In particular, it was found that there was an error in the previous
paper concerning the decomposition of the encoding/decoding operator into
elementary quantum gates. In this paper, a modified encoding/decoding operator,
which can be decomposed efficiently, is presented. The scheme is implemented on
different IBM quantum computers, and the results on different machines are
compared. The encoding/decoding operator are further decomposed into basic
gates, i.e., single qubit gates and CNOT gates, used by the IBM quantum
computers to improve the results. Furthermore, the special type of channels
with the error operators of the form $\sigma_x^{\otimes n}, \sigma_y^{\otimes
n}$ and $\sigma_z^{\otimes n}$ are also studied, where $\sigma_x, \sigma_y,
\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices. A hybrid quantum error correction scheme

for not only theoretical interest but also applications to quantum

uncertainty plays a primary role among several stunning features of quantum
theory. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate fundamental aspects of
uncertainty. In particular, we address this problem focusing on convexity,
which has an operational origin. We first try to reveal why in quantum theory
similar bounds are often obtained for two types of uncertainty relations,
namely, preparation and measurement uncertainty relations. To do this, we
consider uncertainty relations in the most general framework of physics called
generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). It is proven that some geometric
structures of states connect those two types of uncertainty relations in GPTs
in terms of several expressions such as entropic one. Our result implies what
is essential for the close relation between those uncertainty relations. Then
we consider a broader expression of uncertainty in quantum theory called
quantum incompatibility. Motivated by an operational intuition, we propose and
investigate new quantifications of incompatibility which are related directly
to the convexity of states. It is also shown that there can be observed a
notable phenomenon for those quantities even in the simplest incompatibility
for a pair of mutually unbiased qubit observables. Finally, we study
thermodynamical entropy of mixing in quantum theory, which also can be seen as
a quantification of uncertainty. We consider its operationally natural
extension to GPTs, and then try to characterize how specific the entropy in
quantum theory is. It is shown that the operationally natural entropy is
allowed to exist only in classical and quantum-like theories among a class of
GPTs called regular polygon theories.",-0.07938278,0.2330813,0.1663079,B

Pauli operators. Although it is always possible to construct a quantum circuit

resource-efficient circuits are reliably executable on near-term quantum

Swap-gate overhead on quantum devices with limited hardware connectivity. A
common alternative is excluding two-qubit gates, however, this comes at the
cost of restricting the class of diagonalizable sets of Pauli operators to
tensor product bases (TPBs). In this letter, we introduce a theoretical
framework for constructing hardware-tailored (HT) diagonalization circuits. We
apply our framework to group the Pauli operators occurring in the decomposition
of a given Hamiltonian into jointly-HT-diagonalizable sets. We investigate
several classes of popular Hamiltonians and observe that our approach requires
a smaller number of measurements than conventional TPB approaches. Finally, we

It first provides a rigorous way of using discrete time-displacement operators
to generate time-dependent product and multiproduct formulas. Second, it
provides a way to allow qubitization to be employed for certain time-dependent
formulas. We show that as the number of qubits used for the clock grows, the

between the clock register and the register of the state being acted upon. As
an application, we provide a new family of multiproduct formulas (MPFs) for

on known quantum optical systems. While we provide a rather long list of models

developed, in different settings including both exact and approximate solvers.
Addressing this field of research, this manuscript has three distinct purposes.
First, we present an intuitive method for synthesizing and analyzing discrete
(i.e., integer-based) optimization problems, wherein the problem and
corresponding algorithmic primitives are expressed using a discrete quantum
intermediate representation (DQIR) that is encoding-independent. This compact
representation often allows for more efficient problem compilation, automated
analyses of different encoding choices, easier interpretability, more complex
runtime procedures, and richer programmability, as compared to previous
approaches, which we demonstrate with a number of examples. Second, we perform
numerical studies comparing several qubit encodings; the results exhibit a
number of preliminary trends that help guide the choice of encoding for a
particular set of hardware and a particular problem and algorithm. Our study
includes problems related to graph coloring, the traveling salesperson problem,
factory/machine scheduling, financial portfolio rebalancing, and integer linear
programming. Third, we design low-depth graph-derived partial mixers (GDPMs) up
to 16-level quantum variables, demonstrating that compact (binary) encodings
are more amenable to QAOA than previously understood. We expect this toolkit of
programming abstractions and low-level building blocks to aid in designing

not overlap: the quantum nature of light is typically neglected in works on
ultracold atoms. In our work the quantumness of both light and ultracold matter
plays a key role. First, we show that light is a quantum nondemolition (QND)
probe of many-body phases: they can be distinguished by correlations and full
distribution functions (we consider bosons, fermions, and dipolar molecules).
Light is not only sensitive to densities, but also to the matter-field
interference. Second, we prove that the measurement backaction constitutes a
novel source of competitions in many-body systems, especially, for non-QND
cases. This leads to a plethora of new phenomena: oscillations of multipartite
entangled modes, protection and break-up of fermion pairs, antiferromagnetic
orders, long-range pair tunnelling and entanglement beyond Hubbard models. We
prove that feedback control induces phase transitions and tunes their
universality class. Third, the quantization of trapping potential (quantum
optical lattices) leads to novel phases, including both density orders
(supersolids, density waves) and bond orders of matter fields (superfluid and
supersolid dimers, trimers). Results beyond ultracold atoms include: We extend
the paradigm of feedback control from the state control to control of phase
transitions. We present the measurement backaction as a novel source of

of the nonlinearity parameter $\chi$ scales as ""super-Heisenberg scaling""

the nonlinear generator. Here, we find that ""super-Heisenberg scaling""

the single-photon loss, the optimal measurement precision will not appear at
the nonlinearity $\chi=0$ in the case of the one-photon driving.
Counterintuitively, in the case of the two-photon driving we find that it is

identical. We also analyze the Wigner negative volume of the
photon-added/subtracted states. Whereas photon-added Gaussian states are never
Wigner positive, we show that single-mode photon-subtracted states are Wigner

We experimentally investigate the strategy for the optimal discrimination of

unambiguous and minimum error discrimination by solely adjusting the rate of
inconclusive outcomes. We present a versatile experimental scheme that performs

outcomes. Considering different values of the free parameters in the FRIO
protocol, we implement it upon qubit states encoded in the polarization mode of
single photons generated in the spontaneous parametric down-conversion process.

perform a three-outcome non-projective measurement required for the
discrimination task, showing excellent agreement with the theoretical

entropic structure of the stabilizer states, which is ultimately built up by
CNOT gate applications on two qubits, we are motivated to consider the
restricted subgraphs built from the Hadamard and CNOT gates acting on only two
of the $n$ qubits. We show how the two subgraphs already present at two qubits
are embedded into more complicated subgraphs at three and four qubits. We argue
that no additional types of subgraph appear beyond four qubits, but that the
entropic structures within the subgraphs can grow progressively more
complicated as the qubit number increases. Starting at four qubits, some of the
stabilizer states have entropy vectors which are not allowed by holographic
entropy inequalities. We comment on the nature of the transition between
holographic and non-holographic states within the stabilizer reachability
graphs.",-0.05672991,0.31212604,0.08274101,B

to an environment representing the meter and the apparatus. Modelling the
environment as a heat bath comprising only a finite number of boson modes and
represented in a basis of coherent states, following the Davydov ansatz, it can
be fully included in the quantum time evolution of the total system. We perform
numerical simulations of projective measurements of the polarization, with the
spins prepared initially in a neutral pure state. The likewise pure initial
state of the environment is constructed as a product of coherent states of the
boson modes with a random distribution of their centroids around the origin of
phase space. Switching the self-energy of the spin and the coupling to the heat
bath on and off by a time-dependent modulation, we observe the outcome of the
measurement in terms of the long-time behaviour of the spin. Interacting with
the heat bath, the spins get entangled with it and lose coherence, thus
reproduce the ""collapse of the wavefunction"". The expected quantum randomness
in the final state is manifest in our simulations as a tendency of the spin to
approach either one of the two eigenstates of the measured spin operator,
recovering an almost pure state. The unitary time evolution allows us to
reproducibly relate these random final states to the respective initial states
of the environment and to monitor the exchange of information between the two

solving linear equations in many applications. However, applying these
algorithms can be challenging. The Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and
improvements thereof require complex subroutines suitable for fault-tolerant
hardware such as Hamiltonian simulation, making it ill-suited to current
hardware. Variational algorithms, on the other hand, involve expensive
optimization loops, which can be prone to barren plateaus and local optima. We
describe a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations that
avoids these problems. Our algorithm is based on the Woodbury identity, which
analytically describes the inverse of a matrix that is a low-rank modification
of another (easily-invertible) matrix. This approach only utilizes basic
quantum subroutines like the Hadamard test or the swap test, so it is
well-suited to current hardware. There is no optimization loop, so barren
plateaus and local optima do not present a problem. The low-rank aspect of the
identity enables us to efficiently transfer information to and from the quantum
computer. This approach can produce accurate results on current hardware. As
evidence of this, we estimate an inner product involving the solution of a

efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a

improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a
faster convergence rate under the condition $R_D < 1$, where $R_D$ measures the
ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Since
$R_D$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points $n$ while $R$
increases with $n$, the criterion $R_D<1$ is significantly milder than $R<1$
for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for
approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the

statistical behaviors for the different parties at the low-frequency regions

of finding the input to a hidden function that extremizes the function output,
without having direct access to the hidden function, given only partial
input-output (training) data. The algorithm, called quantum extremal learning
(QEL), consists of a parametric quantum circuit that is variationally trained
to model data input-output relationships and where a trainable quantum feature
map, that encodes the input data, is analytically differentiated in order to
find the coordinate that extremizes the model. This enables the combination of
established quantum machine learning modelling with established quantum
optimization, on a single circuit/quantum computer. We have tested our
algorithm on a range of classical datasets based on either discrete or
continuous input variables, both of which are compatible with the algorithm. In
case of discrete variables, we test our algorithm on synthetic problems
formulated based on Max-Cut problem generators and also considering higher
order correlations in the input-output relationships. In case of the continuous
variables, we test our algorithm on synthetic datasets in 1D and simple
ordinary differential functions. We find that the algorithm is able to
successfully find the extremal value of such problems, even when the training
dataset is sparse or a small fraction of the input configuration space. We
additionally show how the algorithm can be used for much more general cases of

challenges in designing quantum network protocols using classical methods. To
address this issue, we develop a variational quantum optimization framework
that simulates quantum networks on quantum hardware and optimizes the network

optimize nonlocality in noisy quantum networks. On the noisy IBM quantum
computers, we demonstrate our framework's ability to maximize quantum

barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically

pairs in form of input and desired output states and therefore can be used for
characterising unknown or untrusted quantum devices. We not only demonstrate
the generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations, but also
implement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the
ultimate limits for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the
quantum no free lunch theorem, which describes a bound on the probability that
a quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is optimised
with quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover
we expand the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first
case, we include additional information beyond just the training data pairs:
since quantum devices are always structured, the resulting data is always
structured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge
about the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the
training process and show that this can lead to better generalisation
behaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including graph structure are
trained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation.

ansatz (SEA) for accurate quantum dynamics simulations with improved

much fewer parameters than a universal ansatz, making it efficient for tasks

entanglement of the prepared state, which could be applied to further improve
the efficiency of simulating weak entanglement. Second, we show that SEA is not
a unitary 2-design even if it has universal wavefunction expressibility and
thus has great potential to improve the trainability by avoiding the zone of
barren plateaus. We further investigate a plethora of examples in ground state
estimation and notably obtain significant improvements in the variances of
derivatives and the overall optimization behaviors. This result indicates that

offers the starting point for the validation of various quantum devices. One of
the central tasks in the field of state tomography is to reconstruct with high
fidelity, the quantum states of a quantum system. From an experiment on a real
quantum device, one can obtain the mean measurement values of different
operators. With such a data as input, in this report we employ the maximal
entropy formalism to construct the least biased mixed quantum state that is
consistent with the given set of expectation values. Even though in principle,
the reported formalism is quite general and should work for an arbitrary set of
observables, in practice we shall demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on
an informationally complete (IC) set of Hermitian operators. Such a set
possesses the advantage of uniquely specifying a single quantum state from
which the experimental measurements have been sampled and hence renders the
rare opportunity to not only construct a least-biased quantum state but even
replicate the exact state prepared experimentally within a preset tolerance.
The primary workhorse of the algorithm is re-constructing an energy function
which we designate as the effective Hamiltonian of the system, and
parameterizing it with Lagrange multipliers, according to the formalism of
maximal entropy. These parameters are thereafter optimized variationally so
that the reconstructed quantum state of the system converges to the true
quantum state within an error threshold. To this end, we employ a parameterized
quantum circuit and a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm to obtain
such a target state making our recipe easily implementable on a near-term

relevant to many important problems in physics and chemistry. In the low
temperature regime, algorithms for these tasks often suffer from
intractabilities, for example from poor sample- or time-complexity. With the
aim of addressing such intractabilities, we introduce a generalization of
quantum natural gradient descent to parameterized mixed states, as well as
provide a robust first-order approximating algorithm, Quantum-Probabilistic
Mirror Descent. We prove data sample efficiency for the dual tasks using tools
from information geometry and quantum metrology, thus generalizing the seminal
result of classical Fisher efficiency to a variational quantum algorithm for
the first time. Our approaches extend previously sample-efficient techniques to
allow for flexibility in model choice, including to spectrally-decomposed
models like Quantum Hamiltonian-Based Models, which may circumvent intractable
time complexities. Our first-order algorithm is derived using a novel quantum
generalization of the classical mirror descent duality. Both results require a
special choice of metric, namely, the Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metric. To test our
proposed algorithms numerically, we compare their performance to existing
baselines on the task of quantum Gibbs sampling for the transverse field Ising
model. Finally, we propose an initialization strategy leveraging geometric
locality for the modelling of sequences of states such as those arising from
quantum-stochastic processes. We demonstrate its effectiveness empirically for

changes in the measurement outcomes). For simple cases the form of
$\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ is known, but the same cannot be said for realistic
scenarios, as no general closed-form expression exists. In this work we present
an inference-based scheme for QS. We show that, for a general class of unitary
families of encoding, $\mathcal{R}(\theta)$ can be fully characterized by only
measuring the system response at $2n+1$ parameters. In turn, this allows us to
infer the value of an unknown parameter given the measured response, as well as
to determine the sensitivity of the sensing scheme, which characterizes its
overall performance. We show that inference error is, with high probability,
smaller than $\delta$, if one measures the system response with a number of
shots that scales only as $\Omega(\log^3(n)/\delta^2)$. Furthermore, the
framework presented can be broadly applied as it remains valid for arbitrary

dynamical settings. First, we expand the resource theory of randomness (RTR) by
calculating the amount of entropy catalytically extractable from a correlated
or dynamical randomness source. In doing so, we show that no entropy can be
catalytically extracted when one cannot implement local projective measurement
on randomness source without altering its state. The RTR, as an archetype of
the `concave' resource theory, is complementary to the convex resource theories
in which the amount of randomness required to erase the resource is a resource
measure. As an application, we prove that quantum operation cannot be hidden in
correlation between two parties without using randomness, which is the
dynamical generalization of the no-hiding theorem. Second, we study the
physical properties of information flow. Popularized quotes like ""information
is physical"" or ""it from bit"" suggest the matter-like picture of information
that can travel with the definite direction while leaving detectable traces on
its region of departure. To examine the validity of this picture, we focus on
that catalysis of randomness models directional flow of information with the
distinguished source and recipient. We show that classical information can
always spread from its source without altering its source or its surrounding
context, like an immaterial entity, while quantum information cannot. We
suggest an approach to formal definition of semantic quantum information and
claim that utilizing semantic information is equivalent to using a partially
depleted information source. By doing so, we unify the utilization of semantic
and non-semantic quantum information and conclude that one can always extract
more information from an incompletely depleted classical randomness source, but
it is not possible for quantum randomness sources.",-0.022748912,0.30626106,-0.15500204,B

classical surrogate, they create a natural benchmark the quantum model has to
outperform. We show that large classes of well-analyzed re-uploading models
have a classical surrogate. We conducted numerical experiments and found that

we present a quantum circuit estimating both the energy and eigenstates
corrections with PT methods, which we claim is far superior to the classical

further demonstrated with an application on the extended Hubbard model, where
numerical simulation based on qiskit is also presented. Unlike the popular

work is focused on providing useful insights and information into the behaviour
of the quantum-annealer when addressing real-world combinatorial optimization
problems. Our main motivation with this study is to open some quantum computing
frontiers to non-expert stakeholders. To this end, we perform an extensive
experimentation, in the form of a parameter sensitive analysis. This
experimentation has been conducted using the Traveling Salesman Problem as
benchmarking problem, and adopting two QUBOs: state-of-the-art and a
heuristically generated. Our analysis has been performed on a single 7-noded
instance, and it is based on more than 200 different parameter configurations,
comprising more than 3700 unitary runs and 7 million of quantum reads. Thanks
to this study, findings related to the energy distribution and most appropriate
parameter settings have been obtained. Finally, an additional study has been
performed, aiming to determine the efficiency of the heuristically built QUBO
in further TSP instances.",0.09019582,0.07533972,0.43625444,B

This result excludes the case of joint measurements of continuous sharp

of possible states. When the states are mutually orthogonal, perfect state
discrimination is alway possible using a global measurement. In the case of
multipartite systems when the parties are constrained to use multiple rounds of
local operations and classical communications (LOCC), perfect state
discrimination is often impossible even with the use of \emph{asymptotic LOCC},
wherein an error is allowed but must vanish in the limit of an infinite number
of rounds. Utilizing our recent results on asymptotic LOCC, we derive a lower
bound on the error probability for LOCC discrimination of any given set of
mutually orthogonal pure states. We use this lower bound to prove necessary
conditions for perfect state discrimination by asymptotic LOCC. We then
illustrate by example the power of these necessary conditions in significantly

quality of point-to-point channels, but by the efficacy of its constituent

developed node-splitting technique which introduces internal losses and noise
into repeater devices, we present achievable end-to-end rates for
noisy-repeater quantum networks. These are obtained by extending the coherent
and reverse coherent information (single channel capacity lower bounds) into
end-to-end capacity lower bounds, both in the context of single-path and
multi-path routing. These achievable rates are completely general, and apply to
networks composed of arbitrary channels arranged in general topologies. Through
this general formalism, we show how tight upper-bounds can also be derived by
supplementing appropriate single-edge capacity bounds. As a result, we develop
tools which provide tight performance bounds for quantum networks constituent
of channels whose capacities are not exactly known, and reveal critical network
properties which are necessary for high-rate quantum communications. This

applications of quantum computers. Multi-Product Formulas (MPFs) are well
suited to replace standard product formulas since they scale better with
respect to time and approximation errors. Hamiltonian simulation with MPFs was
first proposed in a fully quantum setting using a linear combination of
unitaries. Here, we analyze and demonstrate a hybrid quantum-classical approach
to MPFs that classically combines expectation values evaluated with a quantum
computer. This has the same approximation bounds as the fully quantum MPFs,
but, in contrast, requires no additional qubits, no controlled operations, and
is not probabilistic. We show how to design MPFs that do not amplify the
hardware and sampling errors, and demonstrate their performance. In particular,
we illustrate the potential of our work by theoretically analyzing the benefits
when applied to a classically intractable spin-boson model, and by computing
the dynamics of the transverse field Ising model using a classical simulator as
well as quantum hardware. We observe an error reduction of up to an order of
magnitude when compared to a product formula approach by suppressing hardware
noise with Pauli Twirling, pulse efficient transpilation, and a novel
zero-noise extrapolation based on scaled cross-resonance pulses. The MPF
methodology reduces the circuit depth and may therefore represent an important

demonstrate quantitative agreement between quantum annealing and time-evolution
of the Schr\""odinger equation in small spin glasses. We then measure dynamics
in 3D spin glasses on thousands of qubits, where simulation of many-body

magnetic phases, are all driven by thermal energy fluctuations by varying the
temperature. On the other hand, quantum phase transitions happen at absolute
zero temperature with quantum fluctuations causing the ground state energy to
show abrupt changes as one varies the system parameters like electron density,
pressure, disorder, or external magnetic field. Phase transitions happen at
critical values of the controlling parameters, such as the critical temperature
in classical phase transitions, and system critical parameters in the quantum
case. However, true criticality happens only at the thermodynamic limit, when
the number of particles goes to infinity with constant density. To perform the
calculations for the critical parameters, finite size scaling approach was
developed to extrapolate information from a finite system to the thermodynamic
limit. With the advancement in the experimental and theoretical work in the
field of ultra-cold systems, particularly trapping and controlling single
atomic and molecular systems, one can ask: do finite systems exhibit quantum
phase transition? To address this question, finite size scaling for finite
system was developed to calculate the quantum critical parameters. Recent
observation of a quantum phase transition in a single trapped 171 Yb ion in the
Paul trap indicates the possibility of quantum phase transition in finite
systems. This perspective focuses on examining chemical processes at ultracold

magnetic phases, are all driven by thermal energy fluctuations by varying the
temperature. On the other hand, quantum phase transitions happen at absolute
zero temperature with quantum fluctuations causing the ground state energy to
show abrupt changes as one varies the system parameters like electron density,
pressure, disorder, or external magnetic field. Phase transitions happen at
critical values of the controlling parameters, such as the critical temperature
in classical phase transitions, and system critical parameters in the quantum
case. However, true criticality happens only at the thermodynamic limit, when
the number of particles goes to infinity with constant density. To perform the
calculations for the critical parameters, finite size scaling approach was
developed to extrapolate information from a finite system to the thermodynamic
limit. With the advancement in the experimental and theoretical work in the
field of ultra-cold systems, particularly trapping and controlling single
atomic and molecular systems, one can ask: do finite systems exhibit quantum
phase transition? To address this question, finite size scaling for finite
system was developed to calculate the quantum critical parameters. Recent
observation of a quantum phase transition in a single trapped 171 Yb ion in the
Paul trap indicates the possibility of quantum phase transition in finite
systems. This perspective focuses on examining chemical processes at ultracold
temperature as quantum phase transitions, particularly the formation and
dissociation of chemical bonds, which is the basic process for understanding
the whole of chemistry",0.13179785,0.027864588,-0.29294488,A

dissipation of quantum states into the environment. Furthermore, by comparing

the optimal unambiguous state discrimination in Hermitian systems. We also
extend the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric QSD to the case of discriminating three

qubits that are intentionally measured in a conjugate basis. We instantiate

pairs a priori.

require at least five rounds.

entropy by studying its variance. Using the aforementioned results for the
R\'enyi-2 entropy, we upper and lower bound the von Neumann entropy Page curve
and prove certain regimes of entanglement typicality as measured by the von
Neumann entropy. Our main proofs make use of a symmetry property obeyed by the
average and the variance of the entropy that dramatically simplifies the
averaging over unitaries. In this light, we propose future research directions

Stasinou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Stefano Gogioso'), arxiv.Result.Author('Bob Coecke')]","There is a stark tension among different formulations of quantum theory in
that some are fundamentally time-symmetric and others are radically
time-asymmetric. This tension is crisply captured when thinking of physical
theories as theories of processes. We review process theories and their
diagrammatic representation, and show how quantum theory can be described in
this language. The tension between time-symmetry and time-asymmetry is then
captured by the tension between two of the key structures that are used in this
framework. On the one hand, the symmetry is captured by a dagger structure,
which is represented by a reflection of diagrams. On the other hand, the
asymmetry is captured by a condition involving discarding which, ultimately, is
responsible for the theory being compatible with relativistic causality.
  Next we consider three different ways in which we this tension can be
resolved. The first of these is closely related to recent work of Lucien Hardy,
where the tension is resolved by adding in a time reversed version of
discarding together with a suitable consistency condition. The second is, to
our knowledge, a new approach. Here the tension is resolved by adding in new
systems which propagate backwards in time, and imposing a consistency condition
to avoid running into well known time-travel paradoxes. The final approach that
we explore is closely related to work of Oreshkov and Cerf, where the tension
is resolved by removing the constraint associated with discarding. We show two
equivalent ways in which this can be done whilst ensuring that the resulting
theory still makes sensible operational predictions.",0.10420507,0.34758866,-0.09780187,B

Consequently, the optimization landscape can exhibit exponentially vanishing

quantized paradigm in four directions: First, we introduce field states that
transform an atom from its ground or excited state to any point on the Bloch
sphere without residual atom-field entanglement. The best strong pulses for
carrying out rotations by angle $\theta$ are are squeezed in photon-number
variance by a factor of $\rm{sinc}\theta$. Next, we investigate implementing
rotation gates, showing that the optimal Gaussian field state for enacting a
$\theta$ pulse on an atom in an arbitrary, unknown initial state is number
squeezed by less: $\rm{sinc}\tfrac{\theta}{2}$. Third, we extend these
investigations to fields interacting with multiple atoms simultaneously,
discovering once again that number squeezing by $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ is optimal for
enacting $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ pulses on all of the atoms simultaneously, with small
corrections on the order of the ratio of the number of atoms to the average
number of photons. Finally, we find field states that best perform arbitrary
rotations by $\theta$ through nonlinear interactions involving $m$-photon
absorption, where the same optimal squeezing factor is found to be
$\rm{sinc}\theta$. Backaction in a wide variety of atom-field interactions can
thus be mitigated by squeezing the control fields by optimal amounts.",-0.1165739,-0.118444555,-0.032445986,C

channel on a shared bipartite state via non-local quantum computation -- a
protocol consisting of local operations and a single simultaneous round of
quantum communication. Such a protocol can occur in the AdS/CFT correspondence,
with the two parties represented by regions of the CFT, and the holographic
state serving as a resource to provide the necessary entanglement. This
boundary non-local computation is dual to the local implementation of a channel
in the bulk AdS theory. Previous work on this phenomenon was obstructed by the
divergent entanglement between adjacent CFT regions, and tried to circumvent
this issue by assuming that certain regions are irrelevant. However, the
absence of these regions introduces violent phenomena that prevent the CFT from
implementing the protocol. Instead, we resolve the issue of divergent
entanglement by using a finite-memory quantum simulation of the CFT. We show
that any finite-memory quantum system on a circular lattice yields a protocol
for non-local quantum computation. In the case of a quantum simulation of a
holographic CFT, we carefully show that this protocol implements the channel
performed by the local bulk dynamics. Under plausible physical assumptions
about quantum computation in the bulk, our results imply that non-local quantum
computation can be performed for any polynomially complex unitary with a

strategies to control quantum information processing devices in real time
becomes increasingly important. Usually these strategies require a precise
understanding of the device itself, which is generally not available.
Model-free reinforcement learning circumvents this need by discovering control
strategies from scratch without relying on an accurate description of the
quantum system. Furthermore, important tasks like state preparation, gate
teleportation and error correction need feedback at time scales much shorter
than the coherence time, which for superconducting circuits is in the
microsecond range. Developing and training a deep reinforcement learning agent
able to operate in this real-time feedback regime has been an open challenge.
Here, we have implemented such an agent in the form of a latency-optimized deep
neural network on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We demonstrate its
use to efficiently initialize a superconducting qubit into a target state. To
train the agent, we use model-free reinforcement learning that is based solely
on measurement data. We study the agent's performance for strong and weak
measurements, and for three-level readout, and compare with simple strategies
based on thresholding. This demonstration motivates further research towards
adoption of reinforcement learning for real-time feedback control of quantum
devices and more generally any physical system requiring learnable low-latency

states represents a major challenge in the pursuit of quantum error correction
(QEC). In a QEC circuit, leakage builds over time and spreads through
multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the
exponential suppression of logical error with scale, challenging the
feasibility of QEC as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here,
we demonstrate the execution of a distance-3 surface code and distance-21
bit-flip code on a Sycamore quantum processor where leakage is removed from all
qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its
ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a ten-fold reduction
in steady-state leakage population on the data qubits encoding the logical
state and an average leakage population of less than $1 \times 10^{-3}$
throughout the entire device. The leakage removal process itself efficiently
returns leakage population back to the computational basis, and adding it to a
code circuit prevents leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles,
restoring a fundamental assumption of QEC. With this demonstration that leakage
can be contained, we resolve a key challenge for practical QEC at scale.",-0.11233525,-0.06265615,0.35024464,C

based on superconducting qubits, quantum dots, and cold atoms -- can apply
two-qubit gates only on certain pairs of qubits. Other schemes -- such as those
based on trapped ions and photonics -- are not subject to such constraints.
These qubit connectivity constraints are commonly viewed as a disadvantage; for
example, compiling an unrestricted n-qubit quantum circuit to one with poor
qubit connectivity, such as a 1D chain, usually results in a blowup of depth by
$O(n^2)$ and size by $O(n)$. It is appealing to conjecture that this overhead
is unavoidable -- a random circuit on n qubits has $\Theta(n)$ 2-qubit gates in
each layer and a constant fraction of them act on qubits separated by distance
$\Theta(n)$.
  While it is known that almost all n-qubit unitaries need quantum circuits of
$\Omega(4^n/n)$ depth and $\Omega(4^n)$ size to realize, in this paper, we show
that all $n$-qubit unitaries can be implemented by circuits of $O(4^n/n)$ depth
and $O(4^n)$ size even under 1D chain qubit connectivity constraints.
  We extend this result and investigate qubit connectivity along three
directions. First, we consider more general connectivity graphs, and show that
the size can always be made $O(4^n)$ as long as the graph is connected. For
depth, we study d-dimensional grids, complete d-ary trees and expander graphs,
and show results similar to the 1D chain. Second, we consider the case when
ancillae are available. We show that, with ancillae, the depth can be made
polynomial, and the space-depth trade-off is not impaired by the qubit
connectivity constraint unless we have exponentially many ancillae. Third, we
consider special unitaries, including diagonal unitaries and quantum state
preparation, the last being a fundamental task used in many quantum algorithms

with the modern language of quantum mechanics. In fact, the density operator
plays a role similar to that of probability distribution functions in classical
probability theory and statistics. However, the use of the probability
distribution functions in classical theories is founded on premises that seem
intuitively clear enough. Whereas in quantum theory, the situation with
operators is different due to its non-commutativity nature. By exploiting this
difference, quantum estimation theory aims to attain ultra-measurement
precision that would otherwise be impossible with classical resources. In this
thesis, we reviewed all the fundamental principles of classical estimation
theory. Next, we extend our analysis to quantum estimation theory. Due to the
non-commutativity of quantum mechanics, we prove the different families of QFIs
and the corresponding QCRBs. We compared these bounds and discussed their
accessibility in the single-parameter and multiparameter estimation cases. We
also introduce HCRB as the most informative alternative bound suitable for
multiparameter estimation protocols. Since the quantum state of light is the
most accessible in practice, we studied the quantum estimation theory with the
formalism of these types of quantum states. We formulate, with complete
generality, the quantum estimation theory for Gaussian states in terms of their
first and second moments. Furthermore, we address the motivation behind using
Gaussian quantum resources and their advantages in reaching the standard

defined as a convex combination of permutation matrices. The intuition is that
of making the decision process smooth. Doubly stochastic matrices are contained
in the Birkhoff polytope, in which the vertices represent single permutation
matrices. In essence, the algorithm uses smooth constrained optimization to
slide along the edges of the polytope toward the potential solutions on the
vertices. In the experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm, at the cost
of additional computation time, can deliver significant depth reduction when

quantum computing is described by the statistical mechanics of
quasi-distributions. Here we extend this framework to the important $d=2$ qubit
case and show that we can exploit common structures in completely
CSS-preserving protocols that lead to distillation bounds that can out-perform
previous monotone bounds. Moreover, in the case of CSS code projections, we
arrive at a novel cut-off constraint on the code length $n$ of the CSS code as
a function of other code parameters, which implies that for fixed error rate

elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an
implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total
Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more
advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with
complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of
Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power
law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based
on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of
these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter
steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining
with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use
$\left(\eta^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\frac{n^{2/3}}{\eta^{2/3}}\right)n^{1+o(1)}$ gates to
simulate uniform electron gas with $n$ spin orbitals and $\eta$ electrons in
second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best
previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of
nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a
circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of
values, showing that generic $n$-qubit $2$-local Hamiltonians with commuting
terms require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates to evolve with accuracy
$\epsilon=\Omega(1/poly(n))$ for time $t=\Omega(\epsilon)$. Our proof is based
on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal

these sensing schemes and to judge whether there is an enhanced performance.
Several papers have already investigated the fundamental limits based on
different aspects and criteria, some led to different conclusions. In this
paper, we suggest that for linear bosonic sensors that can be modeled as
coupled oscillators below threshold, a measurement of the mode frequency $w_0$
can not has a precision beyond $\frac{\sqrt{\kappa_0}}{2\sqrt{n\tau}}$, in
which $\kappa_{0}$ is the intrinsic loss, $n$ is the average particle number at
that mode and $\tau$ is the measurement time. Such a precision limit can
already be achieved for a single mode passive sensor, and we have proved that
it can not be exceeded by adding gain components, or by coupling it to other
modes to form a n-mode linear sensor. Further more, we recognize that the above
limit is comparative to the frequency uncertainty
($\frac{\sqrt{\kappa_0}}{\sqrt{2 n\tau}}$) for an above-threshold oscillation
mode (e.g. a laser cavity above threshold), which is related to the
Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth limit. This observation makes us conjecture

small circuits with shallow depth, as they are still constrained by the
presence of noise: quantum gates have error rates and quantum states are
fragile due to decoherence. Hence, it is of great importance to optimize the
depth/gate-count when designing quantum circuits for specific tasks. Diagonal
unitary matrices are well-known to be key building blocks of many quantum
algorithms or quantum computing procedures. Prior work has discussed the
synthesis of diagonal unitary matrices over the primitive gate set
$\{\text{CNOT}, R_Z\}$. However, the problem has not yet been fully understood,
since the existing synthesis methods have not optimized the circuit depth.
  In this paper, we propose a depth-optimized synthesis algorithm that
automatically produces a quantum circuit for any given diagonal unitary matrix.
Specially, it not only ensures the asymptotically optimal gate-count, but also
nearly halves the total circuit depth compared with the previous method.
Technically, we discover a uniform circuit rewriting rule well-suited for
reducing the circuit depth. The performance of our synthesis algorithm is both
theoretically analyzed and experimentally validated by evaluations on two
examples. First, we achieve a nearly 50\% depth reduction over Welch's method
for synthesizing random diagonal unitary matrices with up to 16 qubits. Second,
we achieve an average of 22.05\% depth reduction for resynthesizing the

Using resummed couplings we evaluate the energy of the ordering patterns in the
thermodynamic limit using finite unit cells. We apply the proposed approach to
the atomic limit of the extended Bose-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice
at fillings $f=1/2$ and $f=1$. We investigate the ground-state properties of
the antiferromagnetic long-range Ising model on the triangular lattice and
determine a six-fold degenerate plain-stripe phase to be the ground state for
finite decay exponents. We also probe the classical limit of the

relaxation of the set of feasible local density matrices of a many-body quantum
system. The relaxation is obtained by introducing a hierarchy of constraints
between the reduced states of ever-growing sets of lattice sites. The
coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to
eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can
be enforced with reasonable computational means. This can be used to obtain
rigorous lower bounds on the ground state energy of arbitrary local
Hamiltonians, by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex
relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially
depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the
target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin
models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over
locally translation-invariant states of $n\gtrsim 100$ spins. Beyond this

eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can
be enforced with reasonable computational means. This can be used to obtain
rigorous lower bounds on the ground state energy of arbitrary local
Hamiltonians, by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex
relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially
depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the
target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin
models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over

in the double violation region, the optimal trade-off for partially entangled
states can be 11 standard deviations better than that for maximally entangled

consider cases where the eavesdropper, Eve, has limited access to the

modeled by lossy channels between Alice/Bob and Eve, where the transmissivity
of such channels can, in principle, be bounded by monitoring techniques. An
artefact of such lossy channels is the possibility of having bypass channels,
those which are not accessible to Eve, but may not necessarily be characterized
by the users either. This creates interesting, {\it unexplored}, scenarios for
analyzing QKD security. In this paper, we obtain generic bounds on the key rate
in the presence of bypass channels and apply them to continuous-variable QKD
protocols with Gaussian encoding with direct and reverse reconciliation. We
find regimes of operation in which the above restrictions on Eve can
considerably improve system performance. We also develop customised bounds for
several protocols in the BB84 family and show that, in certain regimes, even
the simple protocol of BB84 with weak coherent pulses is able to offer positive
key rates at high channel losses, which would otherwise be impossible under an
unrestricted Eve. In this case the limitation on Eve would allow Alice to send
signals with larger intensities than the optimal value under an ideal Eve,
which effectively reduces the effective channel loss. In all these cases, the
part of the transmitted signal that does not reach Eve can play a non-trivial
role in specifying the achievable key rate. Our work opens up new security

single atoms to perform controlled experiments on quantum many-body systems.
Finding the sequence of control operations to transform an arbitrary
configuration of atoms into a predetermined one requires solving an atom
reconfiguration problem quickly and efficiently. A typical approach to solve
atom reconfiguration problems is to use an assignment algorithm to determine
which atoms to move to which traps. This approach results in control protocols
that exactly minimize the number of displacement operations; however, this
approach does not optimize for the number of displaced atoms nor the number of
times each atom is displaced, resulting in unnecessary control operations that
increase the execution time and failure rate of the control protocol. In this
work, we propose the assignment-rerouting-ordering (aro) algorithm to improve
the performance of assignment-based algorithms in solving atom reconfiguration
problems. The aro algorithm uses an assignment subroutine to minimize the total
distance traveled by all atoms, a rerouting subroutine to reduce the number of
displaced atoms, and an ordering subroutine to guarantee that each atom is
displaced at most once. The ordering subroutine relies on the existence of a
partial ordering of moves that can be obtained using a polynomial-time
algorithm that we introduce within the formal framework of graph theory. We
numerically quantify the performance of the aro algorithm in the presence and
in the absence of loss, and show that it outperforms the exact, approximation,
and heuristic algorithms that we use as benchmarks. Our results are useful for
assembling large configurations of atoms with high success probability and fast

has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and
device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against
IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol
known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving
the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap
between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the
calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close
this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the
fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure
that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective
attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the
repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the
latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that
this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol.
