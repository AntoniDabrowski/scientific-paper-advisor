one-manifolds with defects and values in the Boolean semiring and automata and

languages. To each pair of a regular language and a circular regular language
we associate a topological theory for one-dimensional manifolds with
zero-dimensional defects labelled by letters of the language. This theory takes
values in the Boolean semiring. Universal construction of topological theories
gives rise in this case to a monoidal category of Boolean semilinear
combinations of one-dimensional cobordisms with defects modulo skein relations.
The latter category can be interpreted as a semilinear rigid monoidal closure
of standard structures associated to a regular language, including minimal
deterministic and nondeterministic finite state automata for the language and
the syntactic monoid. The circular language plays the role of a regularizer,
allowing to define the rigid closure of these structures. When the state space
of a single point for a regular language describes a distributive lattice,
there is a unique associated circular language such that the resulting theory
is a Boolean TQFT.",-0.1791246,-0.15243208,-0.039433792,A

characterized as a class of Lie-admissible algebras whose negative left
multiplication operators make representations of the commutator Lie algebras.
We observe that there is a clear analogy between anti-pre-Lie algebras and
pre-Lie algebras by comparing them in terms of several aspects. Furthermore, it
is unexpected that a subclass of anti-pre-Lie algebras, namely admissible
Novikov algebras, correspond to Novikov algebras in terms of $q$-algebras.
Consequently, there is a construction of admissible Novikov algebras from
commutative associative algebras with derivations or more generally, admissible
pairs. The correspondence extends to the level of Poisson type structures,

the Yang-Baxter equation of cardinality $p_1\cdots p_n$, for different prime
numbers $p_1,\ldots, p_n$, are studied. It is proved that they are
multipermutation solutions of level $\leq n$. In particular, there is no simple
solution of a non-prime square-free cardinality. This solves a problem stated
in [F. Ced\'o, J. Okni\'nski, Constructing finite simple solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation, Adv. Math. 391 (2021), 107968] and provides a far
reaching extension of several earlier results on indecomposability of
solutions. The proofs are based on a detailed study of the brace structure on
the permutation group $\mathcal G(X,r)$ associated to such a solution. It is
proved that $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ are the only primes dividing the order of
$\mathcal{G}(X,r)$. Moreover, the Sylow $p_i$-subgroups of $\mathcal{G}(X,r)$
are elementary abelian $p_i$-groups and if $P_i$ denotes the Sylow

geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. It offers a conceptual,
exhaustive and gentle treatment of the twisting procedure, which functorially
creates new differential graded Lie algebras, associative algebras or operads
(as well as their homotopy versions) from a Maurer-Cartan element. The twisting
procedure for (homotopy) associative algebras or (homotopy) Lie algebras is
described by means of the action of the biggest deformation gauge group ever
considered. We give a criterion on quadratic operads for the existence of a
meaningful twisting procedure of their associated categories of algebras. And,
we introduce the twisting procedure for operads \`a la Willwacher using a new
and simpler presentation, which provides us with a wide source of motivating
examples related to graph homology, both recovering known graph complexes (due
to Kontsevich) and introducing some new ones. This book starts with elementary
surveys on gauge theory and deformation theory using differential graded Lie
algebras in order to ease the way to the theory. It finishes with concise
surveys on the fundamental theorem of deformation theory, higher Lie theory,
rational homotopy theory, simplicial theory of homotopy algebras, and the Floer
cohomology of Lagrangian submanifolds, to illustrate deep examples of
applications.",-0.2975626,0.06795955,-0.12761489,A
