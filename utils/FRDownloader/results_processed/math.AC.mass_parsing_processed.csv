Watanabe and Yoshida. The term {\it generalized} refers to the fact that Ulrich
modules are taken with respect to a zero-dimensional ideal which is not
necessarily the maximal ideal, the latter situation corresponding to the
classical theory from the 80's; despite the apparent naivety of the idea, this
passage adds considerable depth to the theory and enlarges its horizon of
applications. First, we address the problem of when the Hom functor preserves
the Ulrich property, and in particular we study relations with semidualizing
modules. Second, we explore horizontal linkage of Ulrich modules, which we use
to provide a characterization of Gorensteiness. Finally, we investigate
connections between Ulrich modules and modules with minimal multiplicity,
including characterizations in terms of relative reduction numbers as well as
the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain blowup modules.",-0.33459672,0.38083214,0.0182941,A
