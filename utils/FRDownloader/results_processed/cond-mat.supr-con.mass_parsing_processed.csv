Nb$_2$C-MXene fabricated by the molten salts method is attracting wide
attention. However, regarding the superconductivity of Nb$_2$C-MXene with
functional F groups (Nb$_2$CF$_x$), there were some conflicting results in
experimental and theoretical studies. Herein, we systematically carried out
experimental and theoretical investigations on the superconductivity in
Nb$_2$C-MXene with the Cl functional group (Nb$_2$CCl$_x$) and Nb$_2$CF$_x$.
The experimental results of the Meissner effect and zero resistivity have
proved that Nb$_2$CClx is superconducting with the transition temperature (Tc)
~ 5.2 K. We extract its superconducting parameters from the temperature
dependence of resistivity and the field dependence of the magnetization. The
Ginzburg-Landau parameter K$_G$$_L$ is estimated to be 2.41, indicating that
Nb$_2$CClx is a typical type-II superconductor. Conversely, both magnetic and
electrical transport measurements demonstrate that Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is not
superconducting. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show that the Tc of Nb$_2$Cl$_x$ is ~ 5.2 K, while Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is
dynamically unstable with imaginary frequency in phonon spectrum, which is in
good agreement with the experimental results. Our studies not only are useful
for clarifying the present inconsistency but also offer referential
significance for future investigations on the superconductivity of MXenes.",-0.17916265,0.16073284,0.055495776,B

high-temperature superconducting LaHx with Tc-103 K at 78 GPa. In the pressure

than the binary La-H system, with the maximum difference of 100 K, and the

suppressed through reducing the grain boundary density, which may serve as a
source of strain and dislocations in this system. The current finding may
indicate that the Nb thin film is prone to the omega phase transition due to

superconductivity with critical temperatures Tc up to 1.85 K and upper critical
fields up to about 14 kOe. This is confirmed by electrical resistivity, heat
capacity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The heat capacity shows a
discontinuity at Tc and temperature dependence below Tc consistent with weak
coupling BCS theory, and suggests a superconducting gap near 0.25 meV. The
superconductivity is type-II and the topological surface states have been
verified by photoemission. A simple picture suggests analogies with the
isostructural magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4, in which a natural
heterostructure hosts complementary properties on different sublattices, and
motivates new interest in this large family of compounds. The existence of both

these materials as promising candidates for the study of topological
superconductivity.",-0.06529494,-0.14653319,0.16988394,B
