multiscale phonon transport, which is critical to the thermal management of

computationally tractable. To include the effects of large temperature
non-equilibrium, we demonstrate a data-free deep learning scheme,
physics-informed neural network (PINN), for solving stationary, mode-resolved
phonon BTE with arbitrary temperature gradients. This scheme uses the
temperature-dependent phonon relaxation times and learns the solutions in
parameterized spaces with both length scale and temperature gradient treated as
input variables. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed PINN can
accurately predict phonon transport (from 1D to 3D) under arbitrary temperature

performance by thoroughly extracting their spin-wave device potential for
higher-dimensional information generation. The reservoir device has a 1-input
exciter and 120-output detectors on the top of a continuous magnetic garnet
film for spin-wave transmission. For various nonlinear and fading-memory
dynamic phenomena distributing in the film space, small in-plane magnetic
fields were used to prepare stripe domain structures and various damping
constants at the film sides and bottom were explored. The ferromagnetic
resonant frequency and relaxation time of spin precession clearly characterized
the change in spin dynamics with the magnetic field and damping constant. The
common input signal for reservoir computing was a 1 GHz cosine wave with random
6-valued amplitude modulation. A basic 120-dimensional reservoir output vector
was obtained from time-series signals at the 120 output detectors under each of
the three magnetic field conditions. Then, 240- and 360-dimensional reservoir
output vectors were also constructed by concatenating two and three basic ones,
respectively. In nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) prediction
tasks, the computational performance was enhanced as the dimension of the
reservoir output vector becomes higher and a significantly low prediction error
was achieved for the 10th-order NARMA using the 360-dimensional vector and
optimum damping constant. The results are clear evidence that the collection of
diverse output signals efficiently increases the dimensionality effective for
reservoir computing, i.e., reservoir-state richness. This paper demonstrates
that performance enhancement through various configuration settings is a
practical approach for on-chip reservoir computing devices with small numbers
of real output nodes.",-0.29459447,-0.20999342,-0.3604826,A

for problems with large dimensions, up to hundreds of millions or even tens of
billions. The computational cost of using any Lanczos algorithm is dominated by
the number of sparse matrix-vector multiplications until suitable convergence
is reached. Block Lanczos replaces sparse matrix-vector multiplication with
sparse matrix-matrix multiplication, which is more efficient, but for a
randomly chosen starting block (or pivot), more multiplications are required to
reach convergence. We find that a bootstrapped pivot block, that is, an initial
block constructed from approximate eigenvectors computed in a truncated space,
leads to a dramatically reduced number of multiplications, significantly
outperforming both standard vector Lanczos and block Lanczos with a random
pivot. A key condition for speed-up is that the pivot block have a non-trivial
overlap with the final converged vectors. We implement this approach in a
configuration-interaction code for nuclear structure, and find a reduction in
time-to-solution by a factor of two or more, up to a factor of ten.",-0.2650038,-0.17440178,-0.2615588,A
