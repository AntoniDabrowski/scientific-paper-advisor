cyclic Hochschild of any cyclic $A_\infty$ algebra equipped with a scalar
product of degree $-d$. In particular, it acts on the cyclic Hochschild complex
of any Poincare duality algebra of degree $d$, and that action factors through
a quotient dg properad $ST_{3-d}$ of ribbon graphs which is in focus of this
paper. We show that its cohomology properad $H^\bullet(ST_{3-d})$ is highly

cohomology of the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$ of stable algebraic curves of genus
$g$ with marked points. This result gives rise to new universal operations in

groups at height $n=0$, as well as a certain duality for the $E_n$-(co)homology
of $\pi$-finite spectra, established by Hopkins and Lurie, at heights $n\ge 1$.
We use this theory to generalize said duality in three different directions.
First, we extend it from $\mathbb{Z}$-module spectra to all (suitably finite)
spectra and use it to compute the discrepancy spectrum of $E_n$. Second, we
lift it to the telescopic setting by replacing $E_n$ with $T(n)$-local higher
cyclotomic extensions, from which we deduce various results on affineness,
Eilenberg--Moore formulas and Galois extensions in the telescopic setting.
Third, we categorify their result into an equivalence of two symmetric monoidal
$\infty$-categories of local systems of $K(n)$-local $E_n$-modules, and relate
it to (semiadditive) redshift phenomena.",0.18081965,0.08072807,0.08529406,C

Motivations from Equivariant Topology

     In this chapter we describe context from equivariant topology and the theory
of stable model categories that motivates our further study of multicategorically
enriched categories, enriched diagrams, enriched Mackey functors, and change of
enrichment.","Related Literature

theories. More generally, enriched presheaf categories provide a classification
and organization for many stable model categories of interest. Changing
enrichments along $K$-theory multifunctors provides an important tool for
constructing spectral Mackey functors from Mackey functors enriched in
algebraic structures such as permutative categories.
  This work gives a detailed development of diagrams, presheaves, and Mackey
functors enriched over closed multicategories. Change of enrichment, including
the relevant compositionality, is treated with care. This framework is applied
to the homotopy theory of enriched diagram and Mackey functor categories,
including equivalences of homotopy theories induced by $K$-theory
multifunctors. Particular applications of interest include diagrams and Mackey
functors enriched in pointed multicategories, permutative categories, and
symmetric spectra.",-0.034976453,0.27590358,-0.1506931,B

that the string topology coproduct is trivial for symmetric spaces of higher
rank. In contrast to this the Chas-Sullivan product for compact symmetric
spaces is highly non-trivial for any rank and we show that there are many
non-nilpotent classes whose powers correspond to the iteration of closed
geodesics.",-0.17853528,0.008955696,0.013613839,B
