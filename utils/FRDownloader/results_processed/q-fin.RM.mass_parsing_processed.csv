Common
investment strategies ensuring these guarantees are challenged nowadays by low
interest rates. Thus, we study an alternative strategy when an insurance
company shares financial risk with a reinsurance company. We model this
situation as a Stackelberg game. The reinsurer is the leader in the game and
maximizes its expected utility by selecting its optimal investment strategy and
a safety loading in the reinsurance contract it offers to the insurer. The
reinsurer can assess how the insurer will rationally react on each action of
the reinsurer. The insurance company is the follower and maximizes its expected
utility by choosing its investment strategy and the amount of reinsurance the
company purchases at the price offered by the reinsurer. In this game, we
derive the Stackelberg equilibrium for general utility functions. For power
utility functions, we calculate the equilibrium explicitly and find that the
reinsurer selects the largest reinsurance premium such that the insurer may
still buy the maximal amount of reinsurance. Since in the equilibrium the
insurer is indifferent in the amount of reinsurance, in practice, the reinsurer
should consider charging a smaller reinsurance premium than the equilibrium
one. Therefore, we propose several criteria for choosing such a discount rate

only slightly better than Logistic Regression in classifying individual
defaults as a function of the covariates, they do outperform it at the
portfolio level. This happens because they capture linear and non-linear
dependence among the covariates, whereas Logistic Regression only captures
linear dependence. The ability of Machine Learning methods to capture
non-linear dependence among the covariates produces higher default correlation

limits their growth and practical implementation. This study proposes a
data-driven explainable case-based reasoning (CBR) system for bankruptcy
prediction. Empirical results from a comparative study show that the proposed
approach performs superior to existing, alternative CBR systems and is
competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning models. We also demonstrate
that the asymmetrical feature similarity comparison mechanism in the proposed
CBR system can effectively capture the asymmetrically distributed nature of
financial attributes, such as a few companies controlling more cash than the
majority, hence improving both the accuracy and explainability of predictions.
In addition, we delicately examine the explainability of the CBR system in the
decision-making process of bankruptcy prediction. While much research suggests
a trade-off between improving prediction accuracy and explainability, our
findings show a prospective research avenue in which an explainable model that
thoroughly incorporates data attributes by design can reconcile the dilemma.",0.20867378,0.5211196,0.4879822,C

financial risk.Due to the wide application, enterprise financial risk analysis
has always been a core research issue in finance. Although there are already
some valuable and impressive surveys on risk management, these surveys
introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances
in enterprise financial risk analysis. Due to the rapid expansion of the
enterprise financial risk analysis, especially from the computer science and
big data perspective, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively
review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize
the existing enterprise financial risk researches, as well as to summarize and
interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of enterprise financial risk
analysis in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better
understanding of the current research status and ideas. This paper provides a
systematic literature review of over 300 articles published on enterprise risk
analysis modelling over a 50-year period, 1968 to 2022. We first introduce the
formal definition of enterprise risk as well as the related concepts. Then, we
categorized the representative works in terms of risk type and summarized the
three aspects of risk analysis. Finally, we compared the analysis methods used
to model the enterprise financial risk. Our goal is to clarify current
cutting-edge research and its possible future directions to model enterprise
risk, aiming to fully understand the mechanisms of enterprise risk

the framework of partial information and (robust) regulatory constraints.
Partial information is characterized by the fact that the stock price itself is
observable to the optimizing financial institution, but the outcome of the
market price of risk $\theta$ is unknown to the institution. The regulator
builds the same or a different belief about the market price of risk as the
financial institution. The solution to our optimization problem takes the same
form as in the full information case: the optimal wealth can be expressed as a
decreasing function of the state price density, and the regulatory threshold is
ensured in the intermediate economic states. The main difference lies in the
terminal state price density depending on the entire evolution of the estimated
market price of risk $\hat{\theta}(s)$. The subjective evaluation of the
regulatory constraint influences the width of the ensured region.",-0.39947635,0.0063068066,-0.35425705,B
