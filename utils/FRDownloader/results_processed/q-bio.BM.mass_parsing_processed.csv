development has been recognised for many years. Hardware and software
developments now mean that this potential is beginning to be realised, and VR
methods are being actively used in this sphere. A recent advance is to use VR
not only to visualise and interact with molecular structures, but also to
interact with molecular dynamics simulations of 'on the fly' (interactive
molecular dynamics in VR, IMD-VR), which is useful not only for flexible
docking but also to examine binding processes and conformational changes.
iMD-VR has been shown to be useful for creating complexes of ligands bound to
target proteins, e.g., recently applied to peptide inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2
main protease. In this review, we use the term 'interactive VR' to refer to
software where interactivity is an inherent part of the user VR experience
e.g., in making structural modifications or interacting with a physically
rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as opposed to simply using VR
controllers to rotate and translate the molecule for enhanced visualisation.
Here, we describe these methods and their application to problems relevant to
drug discovery, highlighting the possibilities that they offer in this arena.
We suggest that the ease of viewing and manipulating molecular structures and
dynamics, and the ability to modify structures on the fly (e.g., adding or
deleting atoms) makes modern interactive VR a valuable tool to add to the
armoury of drug development methods.",-0.20229104,-0.3608755,-0.106393956,A

the data scarcity of active ligands by incorporating drug-target interaction

expensive due to 3D representations of both molecule and protein. Here, we
demonstrate a widely used and fast protein sequence-based reinforcement
learning (RL) model for drug discovery. In the generative model, one of the
reward components, a binding affinity predictor, is based on 1D protein
sequence and molecular SMILES. As a proof of concept, the RL model was utilized
to design molecules for four targets. The generated compounds showed
bioactivities by the validation of both QSAR and molecular docking with
experimental 3D binding pockets. We also found that the performance of
generated molecules depends on the selection of data source training for the
binding predictor. Furthermore, drug design for a kinase without any
