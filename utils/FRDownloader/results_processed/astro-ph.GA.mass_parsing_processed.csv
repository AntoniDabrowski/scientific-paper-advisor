stable. Their collisions with satellite galaxies naturally produce ring
structures, which has been observed and extensively studied. In contrast, at
high redshifts, disc galaxies are still developing and clumpy. These young
galaxies interact with each other more frequently. However, the products of
their collisions remain elusive. Here we systematically study the minor
collisions between a clumpy galaxy and a satellite on orbits with different
initial conditions, and find a new structure that is different from the local
collisional ring galaxies. The clumpness of the target galaxy is fine-tuned by
the values of Toomre parameter, $Q$. Interestingly, a thick and knotty ring
structure is formed without any sign of a central nucleus in the target galaxy.
Our results provide a promising explanation of the empty ring galaxy recently
observed in R5519 at redshift $z=2.19$. Moreover, we show that the clumpy state
of the collided galaxy exists for a much longer timescale, compared to isolated

structures, as well as neutral (HI) and ionized (HII) bubbles. The expanding
nature of these bubbles makes them shape their surroundings and possibly play a
role in the formation and evolution of interstellar filaments. We present APEX
$^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O(2-1) observations of the NGC 6334 molecular cloud. We
investigate the gas velocity structure along and across the 50 pc-long cloud
and towards 75 identified velocity-coherent-filaments (VCFs). We measure a
wealth of velocity gradients along the VCFs. We derive the column density and
velocity power spectra of the VCFs. These power spectra are well represented
with power laws showing similar slopes for both quantities (with a mean of
about -2), albeit some differ by up to a factor of two. The position velocity
diagrams perpendicular to three VCFs show the V-shaped velocity pattern,
corresponding to a bent structure in velocity space with the filament at the
tip of the V surrounded by an extended structure connected to it with a
velocity gradient. This velocity structure is qualitatively similar to that
resulting from numerical simulations of filament formation from large-scale
compression from propagating shock fronts. In addition, the radial profiles
perpendicular to these VCFs hint to small-scale internal impacts from
neighbouring HII bubbles. The observed opposite curvature in velocity space
towards the VCFs points to various origins of large-scale external compressions
from propagating HI bubbles. This suggests the plausible importance of multiple
HI compressions, separated in space and time, in the formation and evolution of
molecular clouds and their star formation history. These latter atomic
compressions due to past and distant star formation events are complemented by
the impact of HII bubbles from present time and local star formation activity.",0.062078286,0.07862474,-0.16932127,B

directly measure the D4000 spectral break index with narrow-band photometry:
this method has been validated using realistic simulations, and then evaluated

the SED-fitting code CIGALE (for both PAUS NBs and broad-band data from
CFHTLS). The direct D4000 measurement has significantly lower SNR than the
CIGALE D4000, however, we find that for $i_{\rm AB}<21$ (two magnitudes above
PAUS completeness limit) all direct D4000 measurements have $SNR>3$. Moreover,
CIGALE underestimates the error by $>$50\%, while the direct D4000 has proper
error estimation within $<$10\%. We study the D4000-stellar mass relationship
for red and blue galaxies, as well as the D4000-SFR dependence: all methods
show agreements with VIPERS within $1\sigma$, and the D4000-mass relation is
especially well reproduced for blue galaxies. We also evaluate how a D4000 cut
classifies galaxies into red/blue compared to machine learning: the CIGALE
D4000 with PAUS NBs has the best results while providing realistic cut values.

(CLAWS) based on an IRAM 30-m large programme which provides a benchmark study
of numerous, faint CO isotopologues in the mm-wavelength regime across the full
disc of M51 (NGC 5194). The survey's core goal is to use the low-J CO
isotopologue lines to constrain CO excitation and chemistry, and therefrom the
local physical conditions of the gas. In this survey paper, we describe the
CLAWS observing and data reduction strategies. We map the J=1-0 and 2-1
transitions of the CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO,$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and
C$^{17}$O, as well as several supplementary lines within the 1 mm and 3 mm

kpc resolution. A total observation time of 149 h offers unprecedented
sensitivity. We use these data to explore several CO isotopologue line ratios
in detail, study their radial (and azimuthal) trends and investigate whether
changes in line ratios stem from changes in ISM properties such as gas
temperatures, densities or chemical abundances. For example, we find negative
radial trends for the $^{13}$CO}/$^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O/$^{12}$CO and
C$^{18}$O/$^{13}$CO line ratios in their J=1-0 transitions. We also find
variations with local environment, such as higher $^{12}$CO(2-1)/(1-0) or
$^{13}$CO/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratios in interarm regions compared to spiral arm
regions. We propose that these aforementioned variations of CO line ratios are
most likely due to a variation of the optical depth, while abundance variations
due to selective nucleosynthesis on a galaxy-wide scale could also play a role.

optical/UV continuum emission, and with strong associated changes in broad line
emission, on much shorter timescales than predicted by standard models of
accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Most such ``changing-look'' or
""changing-state"" AGN -- and at higher luminosities, changing-look quasars
(CLQs) -- have been found via spectroscopic follow-up of known quasars showing
strong photometric variability. The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-IV
includes repeat spectroscopy of large numbers of previously-known quasars, many
selected irrespective of photometric variability, and with spectral epochs
separated by months to decades. Our visual examination of these repeat spectra
for strong broad line variability yielded 61 newly-discovered CLQ candidates.
We quantitatively compare spectral epochs to measure changes in continuum and
H$\beta$ broad line emission, finding 19 CLQs, of which 15 are
newly-recognized. The parent sample includes only broad line quasars, so our
study tends to find objects that have dimmed, i.e., turn-off CLQs. However, we
nevertheless find 4 turn-on CLQs that meet our criteria, albeit with broad
lines in both dim and bright states. We study the response of H$\beta$ and MgII
emission lines to continuum changes. The Eddington ratios of CLQs are low,
and/or their H$\beta$ broad line width is large relative to the overall quasar
population. Repeat quasar spectroscopy in the upcoming SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper
program will reveal significant numbers of CLQs, enhancing our understanding of
the frequency and duty-cycle of such strong variability, and the physics and

orders-of-magnitude from disk-like values in the outer parts to less than

efficiency per free-fall time that also changes by 2 orders-of-magnitude,

25$~km~s$^{-1}$). We find that IRAS08 is similar to other rotating, starburst
galaxies from the literature in the resolved
$\Sigma_{SFR}\propto\Sigma_{mol}^N$ relation. By combining resolved literature
studies we find that distance from the main-sequence is a strong indicator of
the Kennicutt-Schmidt powerlaw slope, with slopes of $N\approx1.6$ for
starbursts from 100-10$^4$~M$_{\odot}$~pc$^{-2}$. Our target is consistent with
a scenario in which violent disk instabilities drive rapid inflows of gas. It
has low values of Toomre-$Q$, and also at all radii the inflow timescale of the
gas is less than the depletion time, which is consistent with the flat
metallicity gradients in IRAS08. We consider these results in light of popular

metallicity starbursts nearby, so the opportunity arises for these two fields
to complement one another, and lead to an improved conception of both stars and
galaxies. Here we review the current state of the art in modelling of massive
star dominated stellar populations, and discuss their applications and
implications for interpreting the distant Universe. Our principle findings
include:
  - Binary evolutionary pathways must be included to understand the stellar
populations in early galaxies.
  - Observations constraining the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of early
galaxies are showing that current models are incomplete. The best current guess
is that some form of accretion onto compact remnants is required.
  - The evolution and fates of very massive stars, of the order of 100Msun and
above, may be key to fully understand aspects of early galaxies.",-0.26398748,-0.12291271,0.044646367,C

abundance and with the high spectral resolution mode we identify 46 individual
H II regions. These H II regions have an average radius of 4.0 pc, star
formation rate $\sim1.3\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and velocity
dispersion $\sim$16 km s$^{-1}$. None of the H II regions appear to be
virialized ($\rm \alpha_{vir}>>1$), and, on average, they show evidence of
ongoing expansion. IC 10's H II regions are offset from the star forming region
size-luminosity scaling relationships, as well as Larson's Law that relates
size and velocity dispersion. We investigate the balance of inward and outward
pressure, $\rm P_{in}$ and $\rm P_{out}$, finding $\rm P_{out}>P_{in}$ in 89%
of H II regions, indicating feedback driven expansion even in these low mass H
II regions. We find warm gas pressure ($\rm P_{gas}$) provides the dominant
contribution to the outward pressure ($\rm P_{out}$). This counteracts the
inward pressure which is dominated by turbulence in the surrounding gas rather
than self-gravity. Five H II regions show evidence of outflows which are most

interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies. These magnetic fields are
due to a dynamo action, which is a process of converting turbulent kinetic
energy to magnetic energy. A dynamo that acts at scales less than the turbulent
driving scale is known as the turbulent dynamo. The ISM is a multiphase medium
and observations suggest that the properties of magnetic fields differ with the
phase. Here, we aim to study how the properties of the turbulent dynamo depend
on the phase. We simulate the non-isothermal turbulent dynamo in a two-phase
medium (most previous work assumes an isothermal gas). We show that the warm
phase ($T\ge10^3~{\rm K}$) is transsonic and the cold phase ($T<10^3~{\rm K}$)
is supersonic. We find that the growth rate of magnetic fields in the
exponentially growing stage is similar in both phases. We compute the terms
responsible for amplification and destruction of vorticity and show that in
both phases vorticity is amplified due to turbulent motions, further amplified
by the baroclinic term in the warm phase, and destroyed by the term for viscous
interactions in the presence of logarithmic density gradients in the cold
phase. We find that the final ratio of magnetic to turbulent kinetic energy is
lower in the cold phase due to a stronger Lorentz force. We show that the
non-isothermal turbulent dynamo is significantly different from its isothermal
counterpart and this demonstrates the need for studying the turbulent dynamo in

pseudo-bulge population and a consistent growth of spheroidal structures
(classical bulges and ellipticals) with significant stellar mass growth in $z =
1-0.35$ and a somewhat flattened trend to $z = 0$. While the physical
mechanisms for this are not obvious, the results are consistent with a
transition from a Universe dominated by disk growth, to a Universe in which
pseudo-bulges are emerging and spheroids are growing. Further study is required
before this can be apportioned to internal secular processes, gas accretion,

dropping to $\sim30\%$ at $z = 0.0$ (representing $\sim33\%$ decline in the

change across the full mass range is in the growth of diffuse bulges. In terms

The precision of the data has been sufficient to reach extremely small

formation of G2 Main-Sequence (MS) stars due to collision\merging of their
primordial counterparts (G1). A similar genesis of both G2 stars and peculiar
objects like low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond pulsars is also implied.
Indeed, we find a significant (at a confidence level > 99,9%) anti-correlation
between the fraction of G1 red giants (N_{G1}/N_{tot}) and stellar encounter
rates among 51 GCs. Moreover, a Milky Way-like initial mass function (IMF)
requires a large fraction of MS stars with masses M_ms < 0.5 M_sun, more
specifically at least ~50% with [0.1-0.5] M_sun. Unlike cluster mass loss,
stellar collisions\merging retain these G1 stars by converting them into more
massive G2 ones, with mainly M_ms > 0.5 M_sun. This process coupled with a
decreasing relative mass loss with increasing GC masses implies a smaller
(N_{G1}/N_{tot}) in more massive GCs with a shallower present day MF. From data
for 35 GCs, we find that such an anti-correlation is significant at 98.3%
confidence level (Spearman's correlation) for 12 most massive GCs (M_GC >
10^{5.3} M_sun) and it is at a confidence level of 89\% for the 12 least
massive GCs (M_GC < 10^{5.1} M_sun). Other fractions of G1 and G2 stars
observed at the bottom of the MS as compared with the red giant branch in a few

line contamination, resulting in a W43-MM2-MM3 catalog of 205 getsf cores. With
a median deconvolved FWHM size of 3400au, core masses range from 0.1Msun to
70Msun and the getsf catalog is 90% complete down to 0.8Msun. The high-mass end
of the core mass function (CMF) of W43-MM2-MM3 is top-heavy compared to the
canonical IMF. Fitting the cumulative CMF with a single power law of the form
N(>logM)\propto M^a, we measured a=-0.95\pm0.04, compared to the canonical
a=-1.35 Salpeter IMF slope. The slope of the CMF is robust with respect to map
processing, extraction software package, and reasonable variations in the
assumptions taken to estimate core masses. We explore several assumptions on
how cores transfer their mass to stars and sub-fragment to predict the IMF
resulting from the W43-MM2-MM3 CMF. In stark contrast to the commonly accepted
paradigm, our result argues against the universality of the CMF shape. More
robust functions of the star-formation efficiency and core sub-fragmentation
are required to better predict the resulting IMF, here suggested to remain
top-heavy at the end of the star-formation phase. If confirmed, the IMFs
emerging from starburst events could inherit their top-heavy shape from their
parental CMFs, challenging the IMF universality.",0.19919318,-0.1885381,-0.3980862,A

these stars and other disk objects, suggesting that star-star mergers result in
rapid mass loss from the remnant to restore an equilibrium mass, while
star-compact object mergers may result in exotic outcomes and even host binary
black hole mergers within themselves. Finally, we examine how these stars react
as the disk dissipates towards the end of its life, and find that they may
return mass to the disk fast enough to extend its lifetime by a factor of
several and/or may drive powerful outflows from the disk. Post-AGN, these stars
rapidly lose mass and form a population of stellar mass black holes around

structures from galactic-scale filaments to tenth-of-a-parsec scale filaments,

large amount of catalogue data from different surveys and provide the most
comprehensive census of filamentary structures to date. Our census consists of

description of filament properties over four orders of magnitudes in length and
eight in mass. Our analysis emphasises the hierarchical and dynamical nature of
filamentary structures. Filaments do not live in isolation, nor they generally
resemble static structures close to equilibrium. We propose that accretion
during filament formation and evolution sets some of the key scaling properties
of filaments. This highlights the role of accretion during filament formation
and evolution and also in setting the initial conditions for star formation.
Overall, the study of filamentary structures during the past decade has been

fate of these young massive clusters (YMCs), and whether they can become the

complex interplay of internal dynamical processes and external galactic
effects. We present the first star-by-star $N$-body models of massive

were formed during the early, bursty mode of star formation in the galaxy. Our
GCs are younger, less massive, and more core collapsed than clusters in the
Milky Way or M31. This is a direct result of the assembly history and
age-metallicity relationship of the GCs' host galaxy: younger clusters are
preferentially born in stronger galactic tidal fields and initially retain
fewer stellar-mass black holes, causing them to lose mass faster and reach core
collapse sooner than their older counterparts. Our results suggest that the
masses and core/half-light radii of GCs are shaped not only by internal
dynamical processes, but by the specific evolutionary history of their host
galaxies as well. These results emphasize that $N$-body studies with realistic

obtained well-resolved CO data (~0.7-1.5 kpc) for a total of 16 galaxies in two
environments. By comparing our ACA CO data with the HI and UV data, we probe
the impacts of the group environment on the cold gas components (CO and HI gas)
and star formation activity. We find that CO and/or HI morphologies are
disturbed in our group members, some of which show highly asymmetric CO
distributions (e.g., IC 5264, NGC 7421, and NGC 7418). In comparison with
isolated galaxies in the xCOLD GASS sample, our group galaxies tend to have low
star formation rates and low H2 gas fractions. Our findings suggest that the
group environment can change the distribution of cold gas components, including
the molecular gas, and star formation properties of galaxies. This is
supporting evidence that pre-processing in the group-like environment can play
an important role in galaxy evolution.",-0.24202836,0.03262826,0.061029255,C

grains with relatively large sizes. Smaller grains can be produced via the
shattering of large grains that have been stochastically accelerated. To
understand this stochastic acceleration, we have implemented novel
magnetohydrodynamic(MHD)-particle-in-cell(PIC) methods into the astrophysical
fluid code RAMSES. We treat dust grains as a set of massive ``superparticles''
that experience aerodynamic drag and Lorentz force. We subject our code to a
range of numerical tests designed to validate our method in different physical
conditions, as well as to illustrate possible mechanisms by which grains can be
accelerated. As a final test as well as a foundation for future work, we
present the results of decaying dusty MHD turbulence simulations with grain
parameters chosen to resemble 1-2 $\mu$m grains in typical cold neutral medium
conditions. We find that in these conditions, these grains can be effectively
accelerated to well beyond their shattering velocities. This is true for both
electrically charged and neutral grains. While the peak of the gas-grain
relative drift velocity distribution is higher for neutral grains, the drift
velocity distribution of charged grains exhibits an extended exponential tail
out to much greater velocities. Even so, the shapes of the distributions are
such that the extra gas-grain coupling provided by the Lorentz force offers

qualitatively reproduce the observed $([{\rm Fe/H}], [\alpha/{\rm Fe}])$

dichotomy in $[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ is primarily due to the sharp fall of
$[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ with time and influenced by star formation history. We

timescale associated with the delay time distribution of Type Ia supernovae

accretion disks"", in which coplanar gas spirals into the inner regions of the
disk, while being consumed by star-formation and removed by outflows.
Observationally there is little evidence for such inflows within the outer
disks of galaxies. Taking realistic gas surface densities from observations,
the radial velocity of the inflow is only a few km s$^{-1}$ within two
scalelengths, but gradually increases with radius to of order 50-100 km
s$^{-1}$ at the very outer disk. The effects of this inflow on the 2-d velocity
field are examined and shown to be broadly similar to those produced by warped
disks, with twist distortions of both the kinematic major and minor axes. By
examining the twists of kinematic distortions and the spiral arms for a sample
of nearby galaxies, we find that the effect of warps are likely to dominate
over the effect of radial inflows. However, we then model mock HI velocity
fields that combine warps with inflow velocities of the strength required in
the modified accretion disks, and show that these composite systems can
actually also be very well matched by pure warped disk models, with $\sim$85\%
of the mock galaxies having a mean absolute error in the residuals of less than

massive cluster and therefore could be an ideal laboratory for studying the
initial conditions of YMC formation. We find 96 sources in the dust continuum,
with masses $\lesssim$3 M$_{\odot}$ and radii of $\sim$10${}^3$ au. The source
masses and separations are more consistent with thermal rather than turbulent
fragmentation. It is not possible to unambiguously determine the dynamical
state of most of the sources, as the uncertainty on virial parameter estimates
is large. We find evidence for large-scale ($\sim$1 pc) converging gas flows,

10$^5$ yr. The highest density gas is found at the convergent point of the
large-scale flows. We expect this cloud to form many high-mass stars, but find

stripping {\it and} starvation of gas inflow play an important role in
quenching satellite galaxies across a range of stellar and halo masses,

outflows, and star formation rates, we show that even at $z=2$, only
$\approx30\%$ of satellite galaxies are able to maintain equilibrium or grow
their reservoir of cool gas - compared to $\approx50\%$ of central galaxies at
this redshift. We find that the number of orbits completed by a satellite is a
very good predictor of its quenching, even more so than the time since infall.
On average, we show that intermediate-mass satellites with $M_{\star}$ between
$10^{9}{\rm M}_{\odot}-10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ will be quenched at first
pericenter in massive group environments, $M_{200}>10^{13.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$;
and will be quenched at second pericenter in less massive group environments,
$M_{200}<10^{13.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. On average, more massive satellites
($M_{\star}>10^{10}{\rm M}_{\odot}$) experience longer depletion time-scales,
being quenched between first and second pericenters in massive groups; while in
smaller group environments, just $\approx30\%$ will be quenched even after two

quench satellite galaxies, direct gas stripping, particularly at pericenters,

the cluster. We show that the black hole recentering scheme employed in many

detect LyC emission in 50% (4/8) galaxies with 2$\sigma$ significance. This
high detection rate suggests that strong Mg II emitters might be more likely to
leak LyC than similar galaxies without strong Mg II. Using photoionization
models, we constrain the escape fraction of Mg II as ~ 15 -- 60%. We confirm
that the escape fraction of Mg II correlates tightly with that of Lyman-alpha
(LyA), which we interpret as an indication that the escape fraction of both
species is controlled by resonant scattering in the same low column density
gas. Furthermore, we show that the combination of the Mg II emission and dust
attenuation can be used to estimate the escape fraction of LyC statistically.

stellar surveys reigniting the discussion on response modes in dynamical
friction. However, the simulation of such features remains computationally
challenging. We used a collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE)+Poisson solver
based on an existing method from the literature. We investigated the density
and velocity response modes in simulations of Galactic-type DM halos accreting
LMC-sized satellites, including the dependence on the halo density profile. We
successfully captured both the local wake and the global over- and underdensity
induced in the host halo. We also captured the velocity response. In line with
previous studies, we find that the code can reproduce the core formation in the
cuspy profile and the satellite core stalling. The angular power spectrum (APS)
response is shown to be sensitive to each density profile. The cored Plummer
density profile seems the most responsive, displaying a richness of modes. At
the end of the simulation, the central halo acquires cylindrical rotation. The
CBE description makes it tenable to capture the response modes with a better
handling of noise in comparison to traditional N-body simulations. Hence, given
a certain noise level, BPM has a lower computational cost than N-body

adopted a combination of the S\'ersic index and Kormendy relation to separate
classical bulges and disc-like pseudo-bulges. We found that the fraction of
pseudo-bulges (classical bulges) smoothly increases (decreases) as the Universe
gets older. In the history of the Universe, there comes a point ($z \approx

fraction of pseudo-bulges rises with increasing bulge to disc half-light radius
ratio until R$_{\rm e}$/R$_{\rm hlr} \approx 0.6$ suggesting concentrated disc
is the most favourable place for pseudo-bulge formation. The mean ellipticity
of pseudo-bulges is always greater than that of classical bulges and it
decreases with decreasing redshift indicating that the bulges tend to be more
axisymmetric with evolution. Also, the massive bulges are progressing towards
axisymmetry at steeper rate than the low-mass bulges. There is no tight

that bright already-known GCs in the M81 group have sizes that are typically
slightly larger than the Subaru PSF in our fields. In the optical bands, GCs
appear to have colours that are only slightly different from stars. The
inclusion of archival IRAC data yields dramatic improvements in colour
separation, as the long wavelength baseline aids somewhat in the separation
from stars and clearly separates GCs from many compact background galaxies. We
show that some previously spectroscopically-identified GCs in the M81 group are
instead foreground stars or background galaxies. GCs close to M82 have radial
velocities suggesting that they fell into the M81 group along with M82. The
overall M81 GC luminosity function is similar to the Milky Way and M31. M81's
outer halo GCs are similar to the Milky Way in their metallicities and numbers,

two Gaussian components, and a non-parametric approach is applied to measure
the kinematics of [O III] and $\rm H\alpha$ emitting gas. Line ratio
diagnostics and spatially resolved maps are derived to examine the origin of
the outflow. The kpc-scale kinematics of [O III] is dominated by a blueshifted

compact radio emission unresolved at a scale of <0.7 pc, with a brightness
temperature of T_b>5x10^7 K. The radio emission is variable by more than a
factor of 2.5 over a few days, based on the data taken from VLA monitoring

stars. Based on the photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia mission, the
membership of stars in more than 2000 Galactic clusters has been identified in
the literature. The chemical and kinematical properties, however, are still
poorly known for many of these clusters. In synergy with the large
spectroscopic survey LAMOST (data release 8) and Gaia (data release 2), we
report a new comprehensive catalogue of 386 open clusters. This catalogue has
homogeneous parameter determinations of radial velocity, metallicity, and
dynamical properties, such as orbit, eccentricity, angular momenta, total
energy, and 3D Galactic velocity. These parameters allow the first radial
velocity determination and the first spectroscopic [Fe/H] determination for 44
and 137 clusters, respectively. The metallicity distribution of majority
clusters shows falling trends in the parameter space of the Galactocentric
radius, the total energy, and the Z component of angular momentum -- except for
two old groups that show flat tails in their own parameter planes. Cluster
populations of ages younger and older than 500 Myrs distribute diversely on the
disc. The latter has a spatial consistency with the Galactic disc flare. The
3-D spatial comparison between very young clusters (< 100 Myr) and nearby
molecular clouds revealed a wide range of metallicity distribution along the
Radcliffe gas cloud wave, indicating a possible inhomogeneous mixing or fast
star formation along the wave. This catalogue would serve the community as a

although the hosts of high-redshift RLAGNs with the highest luminosities still
have a rounder shape compared with the non-RLAGNs, they on average have a
smaller axis ratio (more elongated) than the local RLAGNs with similar stellar
masses and radio luminosities. This evolution can be interpreted as a byproduct
of radio luminosity evolution, namely that galaxies at fixed stellar mass are
more radio luminous at high redshifts: artificially increasing the radio
luminosities of local galaxies ($z\leq$0.3) by a factor of 2 to 4 can remove
the observed evolution of the axis ratio distribution. If this interpretation
is correct then the implication is that the link between AGN radio luminosity

first epoch of JWST NIRCam imaging from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release
Science (CEERS) Survey. We searched for z>12 sources using photo-z's based
primarily on the expected Lyman-alpha breaks. Following conservative vetting
criteria, we identify a robust source at z_phot=14.3 (+0.4, -1.1, 1-sig
uncertainty) with F277W=27.8, and detections in five (two) filters at >5sig
(>10sig) significance. This object (dubbed Maisie's Galaxy) exhibits a strong
F150W-F200W Lyman-alpha break color of >2.5 mag (1sig), resulting in 99.99%
(87%) of the photo-z PDF favoring z>10 (13). The source may be marginally
detected by HST in F160W, which would widen the lower-redshift bound to z~12.5.
This slightly lower-redshift interpretation would require very strong Ly-alpha
emission (>300 A rest equivalent width), requiring an extremely early ionized
bubble. The colors of this object are inconsistent with Galactic stars, and it
is resolved (r_h=0.1+/-0.01""; 330 pc). All data quality images show no
artifacts at the candidate's position. Independent methods are in robust
agreement, and we consistently find a strong preference for z>13 with our
fiducial photometry. Maisie's Galaxy appears to be fairly high mass (log
M*/Msol~8.5) and highly star-forming (log sSFR ~ -7.9/yr) for this early epoch,
with a blue rest-UV color (beta~-2.3) indicating little dust, though not
extremely low metallicities. While the presence of this source is in tension
with most cosmological simulation predictions and may seriously challenge dark
matter models with suppressed small-scale power, it is in agreement with
empirical extrapolations from lower redshift assuming a smoothly declining
cosmic SFR density. Should followup spectroscopy validate this redshift, our

present a statistical study of galaxy quenching in 17 cluster candidates at
0.5<z<1.0 in the COSMOS field. We selected cluster members with a wide range of
stellar mass and environment to study their mass and environment dependence.
Member galaxies are classified into star-forming, quiescent and
recently-quenched galaxies (RQG) using the rest-frame UVJ diagram. We further
separated fast and slow quenching RQGs by model evolutionary tracks on the UVJ
diagram. We defined the quenching efficiency as the ratio of RQGs over
star-forming galaxies and the quenching stage as the ratio of RQGs over
quiescent galaxies to quantify the quenching processes. We found quenching
efficiency is enhanced by both higher stellar mass and denser environment.
Massive or dense environment galaxies quench earlier. Slow quenching is more
dominant for massive galaxies and at lower redshifts, but no clear dependence
on the environment is found. Our results suggest that low-mass galaxies in
dense environments are likely quenched through a short-timescale process such
as ram pressure stripping, while massive galaxies in a sparse environment are
mostly quenched by a longer-timescale process. Using the line strength of
H$\delta$ and [OII], we confirmed that our UVJ method to select RQGs agrees
with high S/N DEIMOS spectra. However, we caution that the visibility time
(duration of a galaxy's stay in the RQG region on the UVJ diagram) may also
depend on mass or environment. The method introduced in this work can be
applied to RQG candidates for future statistical RQG spectroscopic surveys. The

release astrometry combined with the Gaia second data release radial velocity
measurements of almost 5.5 million stars to identify the local stellar
kinematic substructures in the solar neighborhood. Understanding these
structures helps build a more complete picture of the formation of the Milky
Way, as well as an empirical phase space distribution of dark matter that would
inform detection experiments. The main goal of this study is to provide a list
of the most stable clusters, by taking into account the measurement
uncertainties and studying the stability of the clustering results. We apply
the clustering algorithm in two spaces, in velocity space in order to study
recently accreted structures, and in action-angle space to find phase-mixed
structures. We find 23 (6) robust clusters in velocity space (action-angle
space) that are consistently not associated with noise. They are attributed to
the known structures: the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus, the Helmi Stream, and
globular cluster NGC 3201 are found in both spaces, while NGC 104 and the thick
disk (Sequoia) are identified in velocity space (action-angle space). We
discuss the kinematic properties of these structures and study whether many of
the small clusters belong to a similar larger cluster based on their chemical
abundances. Although we do not identify any new structures, we find that the
HDBSCAN member selection of already known structures is unstable to input
kinematics of the stars when resampled within their uncertainties. We therefore
present the most stable subset of local kinematic structures, which are
consistently identified by the clustering algorithm, and emphasize the need to
take into account error propagation during both the manual and automated
identification of stellar structures, both for existing ones as well as future
discoveries. (abridged)",0.20460239,-0.18783239,0.20801207,A

The dual fraction is roughly constant while the offset fraction increases by a
factor of ten from $z=4\sim2$. Compared with the full AGN population, duals are
characterized by a low $M_\text{BH}/M_*$ ratio, a high specific star-formation
rate (sSFR) of $\sim 1\,\text{Gyr}^{-1}$, and a high Eddington ratio ($\sim
0.05$, double that of single AGN). The dual AGN are formed in major galaxy
mergers (typically involving $M_\text{halo}<10^{13}\,M_\odot$), with BHs that
have similar masses. At small separations (when their host galaxies are in the
late phase of the merger) duals become $2\sim8$ times brighter (albeit more
obscured) than at larger separations. $80\%$ of these bright, close duals merge
in the simulation within $\sim500\,\text{Myrs}$. Notably, the initially
less-massive BH in duals frequently becomes the brighter AGN during the galaxy
merger. In offset AGN, the active BH is typically $\gtrsim 10$ times more
massive than its non-active counterpart and than most BHs in duals. Offsets are
predominantly formed in minor galaxy mergers with the active BH residing in the
center of massive halos ($ M_\text{ halo}\sim 10^{13-14}\,M_\odot$). In these
deep potentials, gas stripping is common and the secondary quickly deactivates.

few years, there is now a catalogue being developed for all-sky extragalactic
dispersion measure (DM) observations in addition to the existing collection of
all-sky extragalactic Faraday rotation measurements (RMs) of radio galaxies. We
present a method of reconstructing all-sky information of the Galactic magnetic
field component parallel to the line of sight, $B_{\parallel}$, using simulated
observations of the RM and DM along lines of sight to radio galaxies and FRB
populations, respectively. This technique is capable of distinguishing between
different input Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density models.
Significant extragalactic contributions to the DM are the predominant
impediment in accurately reconstructing the Galactic DM and
$\left<B_{\parallel}\right>$ skies. We look at ways to improve the
reconstruction by applying a filtering algorithm on the simulated DM lines of
sight and we derive generalized corrections for DM observations at $|b|$ > 10

Overall, we are able to reconstruct both large-scale Galactic structure and
local features in the Milky Way's magnetic field from the assumed models. We
discuss the application of this technique to future FRB observations and

To help constrain stellar and galactic chemical evolution models, numerous and
precise Li abundances are necessary for a large range of evolutionary stages,
metallicities, and Galactic volume. In the age of industrial parametrization,
spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, GALAH, RAVE, and LAMOST have used
data-driven methods to rapidly and precisely infer stellar labels (atmospheric
parameters and abundances). To prepare grounds for future spectroscopic surveys
like 4MOST and WEAVE, we aim to apply machine-learning techniques for Li
study/measurement. We train a Convolution Neural-Network (CNN) coupling
Gaia-ESO Survey iDR6 stellar labels ($\mathrm{\textit{T}_{\text{eff}}}$,
log(g), [Fe/H] and A(Li)) and GIRAFFE HR15N spectra, to infer the atmospheric
parameters and Li abundances for $\sim$40000 stars. We show that the CNN
properly learns the physics of the stellar labels, from relevant spectral
features, over a large range of evolutionary stages and stellar parameters. The
Li feature at 6707.8 A is successfully singled out by our CNN, among the
thousands of lines in the GIRAFFE HR15N setup. Rare objects like Li-rich giants
are found in our sample. Such performances are achieved thanks to a
meticulously built high-quality and homogeneous training sample. The CNN
approach is very well adapted for the next generations of spectroscopic surveys
aiming at studying (among other elements) Li, such as the 4MIDABLE-LR/HR (4MOST

the caveats of the machine-learning applications should be properly

seen in their sublimation temperatures and validates the idea of onion-like
structure of COMs around protostars. Moreover, the molecules studied here show
constant column density ratios across low- and high-mass protostars with
scatter less than a factor $\sim3$ around the mean. The constant column density
ratios point to a common formation environment of COMs or their precursors,

either have a physical origin (source structure, line or dust optical depth) or
a chemical one. Formamide is most prone to the physical effects as it is
tracing the closest regions to the protostars, whereas such effects are small

smaller supermassive black hole (SMBH) scales by an episodic cycle of feeding

and the majority of AGN energy, in near-Eddington regime, is produced in thin
sub-pc accretion discs. Currently, it is very difficult to model processes that
occur on vastly different scales, ranging from the circumnuclear gas reservoirs
at tens to hundreds of parsecs, down to the accretion disc scales at <0.01 pc.

model in parsec-scale simulations, where it is important to get accurate
timescales to understand how feedback affects gas dynamics and star formation

accretion disc model, coupled to the SMBH, in a set of hydrodynamical
simulations of a retrograde collision between a gas ring and a molecular cloud

The disc-mediated feeding of the SMBH is relatively smooth and delayed compared

components, the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) and the nuclear star cluster (NSC).
Recent work has suggested that the NSD and the NSC can be distinguished along
the line of sight towards the NSC via the different extinction of their stars.
This motivated us to analyse the proper motion, radial velocity, and the
metallicity distributions of the different extinction groups. We use
photometric, kinematic, and metallicity data to distinguish between probable
NSD and NSC stars in a region centred on the NSC. We detected two different
extinction groups of stars and obtained significantly different proper motion
distributions for each of them, in agreement with the expected kinematics for
the NSD and the NSC. We derived radial velocity maps that appear to be
different for the NSD and the NSC. We also found different metallicities for
each of the components, with the largest one measured for the most extinguished
group of stars. We obtained that the metallicity distribution of each
extinction group is best fitted by a bimodal distribution, indicating the
presence of two metallicity components for each of them (a broad one slightly
below solar metallicity, and a more metal rich narrower one, that is largest
for the high extinction group of stars). We conclude that both extinction
groups are distinct GC components with different kinematics and metallicity,
and correspond to the NSD and the NSC. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish
them via their different extinction. The high mean metallicity,

assemble in the early universe. Finding signposts of such over-dense regions is
a popular method to identify protocluster candidates. Hyperluminous infrared
galaxies (HLIRGs), are expected to reside in overdense regions with massive
halos. We study the Mpc-scale environment of the largest HLIRG sample to date
and investigate whether they predominantly live in overdense regions. We first
explore the surface density of Herschel 250 $\mu$m sources around HLIRGs and
compare with that around random positions. Then, we compare the spatial
distribution of neighbours around HLIRGs with that around randomly selected
galaxies using a deep IRAC-selected catalogue with good-quality photometric
redshifts. We also use a redshift-matched quasar sample and submillimeter
galaxy (SMG) sample to validate our method, as previous clustering studies have
measured the host halo masses of these populations. Finally, we adopt a Friends
of Friends (FOF) algorithm to seek (proto)clusters that host HLIRGs. We find
that HLIRGs tend to have more bright star-forming neighbours (with 250 $\mu$m
flux density >10 mJy) within 100$\arcsec$ projected radius than a random galaxy
at a 3.7$\sigma$ significance. In our 3D analysis, we find relatively weak
excess of IRAC-selected sources within 3 Mpc around HLIRGs compared with random
galaxy neighbours, mainly influenced by photometric redshift uncertainty and
survey depth. We find a more significant difference (at a 4.7$\sigma$
significance) in the number of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)-detected neighbours

off-centered blue clump to the northeast (the NE clump) that shows low
metallicity and enhanced star-formation. The kinematics of the gas in the NE
clump also seems to be detached from the host BCD galaxy. Together with the
metallicity drop of the NE clump, it suggests that the NE clump likely has an
external origin, such as the gas accretion or galaxy interaction, rather than
an internal origin, such as an \hii~complex in the disk. After removing the
underlying host component, we find that the spectrum of the ""pure"" clump can
match very well with a modeled spectrum containing a stellar population of the
young stars ($\le 7$ Myr) only. This may imply that the galaxy is experiencing
an accretion of cold gas, instead of a merger event involving galaxies with

identified in overlapping regions of the Dark Energy Survey and Atacama
Cosmology Telescope Survey (DES-ACT), covering the redshift range
$0.20<z<0.80$. Using this sample, we measure no change in the ICL's stellar
content (between 50-300\,kpc) over this redshift range in clusters with
log${_{10}}(M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$/M$_{\odot})>$14.4. We also measure the stellar
mass - halo mass (SMHM) relation for the BCG+ICL system and find that the
slope, $\beta$, which characterises the dependence of $M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$ on the
BCG+ICL stellar mass, increases with radius. The outskirts are more strongly
correlated with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system
follows a two-phase growth, where recent growth ($z<2$) occurs beyond the BCG's
core. Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the
IllustrisTNG 300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate
qualitative agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM
relation's slope is steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower,
likely from the absence of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we
find that the ICL exhibits a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer
than the core. Moreover, for the lower halo mass clusters (log$_{10}(M_{\rm

log$_{10}(M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$/M$_{\odot})>$14.4. We also measure the stellar mass

$\beta$, which characterises the dependence of $M_{\rm 200m,SZ}$ on the BCG+ICL
stellar mass, increases with radius. The outskirts are more strongly correlated
with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system follows a
two-phase growth, where recent growth ($z<2$) occurs beyond the BCG's core.
Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the IllustrisTNG
300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate qualitative
agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM relation's slope is
steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower, likely from the absence
of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we find that the ICL exhibits
a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer than the core. Moreover,

(EHVOs), may be key to understanding feedback processes as it is likely the
most powerful in terms of mass-energy. These EHVOs have been observed at
redshifts 1.052 < z_em < 7.641, but the potential connection with outflows in
emission had not been studied. We find that EHVOs, albeit their small numbers
at the moment, appear to show distinct CIV and HeII properties. In particular,
EHVOs are more predominant in quasars with large blueshifts of the CIV emission
line, suggesting a connection between emission and absorption outflowing
signatures for these extreme outflows. We also find incipient trends with the
maximum velocity of the outflows, which is similar to what has been previously
found in BALQSOs, but now extending previous studies to speeds up to ~0.2c. We
find the bolometric luminosities, Eddington ratios, and black hole masses of
our sample are overall very similar from the general quasar population upon
considering their CIV emission properties. This is close to the case for HeII
EW as we observe a tentative upper limit to the HeII strength for a quasar to
host an EHVO. This study shows that extreme outflows such as EHVOs appear in
quasars that are clearly a distinct class from the overall BALQSO population,
and solidify the relation between outflows observed in emission and in
absorption.",-0.045068692,0.29688957,-0.016389992,B_centroid

centered ~29' from the cluster center, with expected magnifications of $\mu$ <~

between 25.9 and 28.1 mag and intrinsic F200W AB magnitudes between 26.4 and
29.7 mag ($M_{UV}$ = -22.5 to -17). We find the stellar masses of these
galaxies are in the range $\log M_{*}/M_{\odot}$ = 8 - 9, and down to 7.5 for
the lensed galaxies. All are young with mass-weighted ages < 100 Myr, low dust
content $A_V$ < 0.15 mag, and high specific star formation rates sSFR ~10-50
Gyr$^{-1}$ for most. One z ~ 9 candidate is consistent with an age < 5 Myr and
a sSFR ~250 Gyr$^{-1}$, as inferred from a strong F444W excess, implying
[OIII]+H-beta rest-frame equivalent width ~2000 Angstrom, although an older and
redder z~ 10 object is also allowed. Another z~9 candidate ID9356 is lensed
into an arc 2.6"" long by the effects of strong gravitational lensing ($\mu$~8),
and has at least two bright knots of unevenly distributed star formation. This
arc is the most spatially-resolved galaxy at z~9 known to date, revealing
structures ~30 pc across. Follow-up spectroscopy of WHL0137 with JWST/NIRSpec

dense cores of giant molecular clouds. Some old star clusters have larger
sizes, and it is unclear if these represent a fundamentally different mode of
low-density star cluster formation. We report the discovery of a rare, young
""faint fuzzy"" star cluster, NGC 247-SC1, on the outskirts of the low-mass
spiral galaxy NGC 247 in the nearby Sculptor group, and measure its radial
velocity using Keck spectroscopy. We use Hubble Space Telescope imaging to
measure the cluster half-light radius of $r_{\rm h} \simeq 12$ pc and a
luminosity of $L_V \simeq 4\times10^5 \mathrm{L}_\odot$. We produce a
colour-magnitude diagram of cluster stars and compare to theoretical
isochrones, finding an age of $\simeq$ 300 Myr, a metallicity of [$Z$/H] $\sim

$\lesssim$ 50 Myr, while no old red-giant branch stars are found, so SC1 is
consistent with hosting a single stellar population, modulo several unexplained
bright ""red straggler"" stars. SC1 appears to be surrounded by tidal debris, at
the end of a $\sim$ 2 kpc long stellar filament that also hosts two low-mass,

inferred star formation histories (SFHs) in 8 massive, quiescent galaxies at
$\mathrm{z\sim0.7}$. Half of the sample have clear detections of molecular gas,
traced by CO(2-1). We find that the molecular gas content is unrelated to the
rate of star formation decline prior to the most recent 1 Gyr, suggesting that
the gas reservoirs are not leftover from their primary star formation epoch.
However, the recent SFHs of CO-detected galaxies demonstrate evidence for
secondary bursts of star formation in their last Gyr. The fraction of stellar
mass formed in these secondary bursts ranges from
$\mathrm{f_{burst}\approx0.3-6\%}$, and ended between
$\mathrm{t_{end\mbox{-}burst}\approx0-330~Myr}$ ago. The CO-detected galaxies
form a higher fraction of mass in the last Gyr
($\mathrm{f_{M_{1Gyr}}=2.6\pm1.8\%}$) compared to the CO-undetected galaxies
($\mathrm{f_{M_{1Gyr}}=0.2\pm0.1\%}$). The galaxies with gas reservoirs have
enhanced late-time star formation, highlighting this as a contributing factor
to the observed heterogeneity in the gas reservoirs in high-redshift quiescent
galaxies. We find that the amount of gas and star formation driven by these
secondary bursts are inconsistent with that expected from dry minor mergers,
and instead are likely driven by recently-accreted gas i.e., gas-rich minor
mergers. This conclusion would not have been made based on
$\mathrm{SFR_{UV+IR}}$ measurements alone, highlighting the power of detailed

based on photometry from the HST Advanced Camera Virgo Survey, in less massive
Virgo galaxies. This characteristic can be traced up to to 45 arcmin (217 Kpc)

Virgo has been regulated, at least partially, by a collective process composed
by several discrete events, working on spatial scales comparable to the size of
the galaxy cluster. Furthermore, the presence of a similar colour pattern in
NGC 5128, at the outskirsts of the Virgo Super-cluster, poses an intriguing
question about the spatial scale of the phenomenon. The nature of the process

resolution in a set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) using the grid-based code RAMSES-RT. We adopt, for the
first time to our best knowledge, realistic initial/boundary conditions by
zooming-in onto individual massive prestellar cores within the GMC. We identify
two distinct modes of fragmentation: ""quasi-spherical"" and ""filamentary"". In
both modes the fragments eventually become embedded in a quasi-steady accretion
disk or toroid with radii ~ 500-5000 AU and opening angles $H/R \sim 0.5-1$.
The disks/toroids are Toomre stable but the accreted pre-existing fragments are
found orbiting the outer disk, appearing as disk fragmentation. Each core
converts nearly 100 percent of the gas mass into a few massive stars forming
near the disk center. Large and massive disks around high-mass stars are
supported by magnetic pressure in the outer disk, at radii >200-1000 AU, and
turbulent pressure in the inner disk. The most massive core accretes several
times more mass than its initial mass, forming a (proto)star cluster of 8
massive stars enshrouded by a toroid, suggesting a competitive accretion
scenario for ultra-high-mass star formation. We also find that the HII regions
produced by a single massive star remain trapped in the dense circumstellar
disks for a few hundred kiloyears, while the dynamic motions of massive stars
in wide binaries or multiple systems displace the stars from the densest parts
of the disk, allowing UV radiation to escape producing steady or pulsating
bipolar HII regions.",-0.14962745,-0.17458142,-0.17819577,C

threshold (prah) of their cluster of origin into the classical tidal tails. The
asymmetry between the number of stars in the leading and trailing tails tests
gravitational theory. All five open clusters with tail data (Hyades, Praesepe,
Coma Berenices, COIN-Gaia 13, NGC 752) have visibly more stars within dcl = 50
pc of their centre in their leading than their trailing tail. Using the
Jerabkova-compact-convergent-point (CCP) method, the extended tails have been
mapped out for four nearby 600-2000 Myr old open clusters to dcl>50 pc. These
are on near-circular Galactocentric orbits, a formula for estimating the
orbital eccentricity of an open cluster being derived. Applying the Phantom of
Ramses code to this problem, in Newtonian gravitation the tails are
near-symmetrical. In Milgromian dynamics (MOND) the asymmetry reaches the
observed values for 50 < dcl/pc < 200, being maximal near peri-galacticon, and
can slightly invert near apo-galacticon, and the K\""upper epicyclic
overdensities are asymmetrically spaced. Clusters on circular orbits develop
orbital eccentricity due to the asymmetrical spill-out, therewith spinning up
opposite to their orbital angular momentum. This positive dynamical feedback
suggests Milgromian open clusters to demise rapidly as their orbital
eccentricity keeps increasing. Future work is necessary to better delineate the
tidal tails around open clusters of different ages and to develop a Milgromian

larger variation in red fraction from lower to higher density, as compared to
the geometric environment. By comparing the different environmental densities
pairwise, we show that no density measurement fully explains the observed
environmental red fraction variation, suggesting the different densities
contain different information. We test whether the local environmental
measures, when combined together, can explain all the observed environmental
red fraction variation. The geometric environment has a small residual effect,
and this effect is larger for voids than any other type of geometric
environment. This could provide a test of the physics applied to

host galaxies' dark matter halos. Using N-body simulations incorporating
semianalytic dynamical friction and GC-GC merger prescriptions, we study the
evolution of GC radial distributions and mass functions in cuspy and cored dark
matter halos. Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy
UGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of
massive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs
and the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC). However, the multiple
mergers required to form the NSC only take place when the dark matter halo is
cuspy. In a cored halo, stalling of the dynamical friction within the core
halts the inspiral of the GCs, and so the GC merger rate falls significantly,
precluding the formation of an NSC. We therefore argue that the presence of an
NSC requires a cusp in UGC7369. More generally, we propose that the presence of
an NSC and the corresponding alteration of the GC mass function due to mergers
may be used as an indicator of a cuspy halo for galaxies in which we expect NSC
formation to be merger-dominated. These observables represent a simple,
powerful complement to other inner halo density profile constraint techniques,
and should allow for straightforward extension to larger samples.",-0.26690018,-0.015048603,0.005114129,C

G214.5-1.8 (G214.5) using Herschel data. We find that G214.5 has a mass of
$\sim$ 16,000 M$_{\odot}$, yet hosts only 15 potentially protostellar 70 $\mu$m
sources, making it highly quiescent compared to equally massive clouds such as
Serpens and Mon R2. We show that G214.5 has a unique morphology, consisting of
a narrow `Main filament' running north-south and a perpendicular `Head'
structure running east-west. We identify 33 distinct massive clumps from the
column density maps, 8 of which are protostellar. However, the star formation
activity is not evenly spread across G214.5 but rather predominantly located in
the Main filament. Studying the Main filament in a manner similar to previous
works, we find that G214.5 is most like a 'Bone' candidate GMF, highly
elongated and massive, but it is colder and narrower than any such GMF. It also
differs significantly due to its low fraction of high column density gas.
Studying the radial profile, we discover that G214.5 is highly asymmetric and
resembles filaments which are known to be compressed externally. Considering
its environment, we find that G214.5 is co-incident, spatially and
kinematically, with a HI superbubble. We discuss how a potential interaction
between G214.5 and the superbubble may explain G214.5's morphology, asymmetry

intersection of a bubble-driven interstellar medium paradigm with that of a
filament paradigm for star formation.",0.17199185,-0.38820228,0.086373925,A

polarization. At high significance (p~1e-4), we exclude a random distribution
of relative orientations and find that there is a preference for alignment of
projected plane of sky outflow axes with magnetic field directions. The
distribution of relative position angles peaks at ~30deg and exhibits a broad
dispersion of ~50deg. These results indicate that magnetic fields have
dynamical influence in regulating the launching and/or propagation directions
of outflows. However, the significant dispersion around perfect alignment
orientation implies that there are large measurement uncertainties and/or a
high degree of intrinsic variation caused by other physical processes, such as
turbulence or strong stellar dynamical interactions. Outflow to magnetic field
alignment is expected to lead to a correlation in the directions of nearby
outflow pairs, depending on the degree of order of the field. Analyzing this
effect we find limited correlation, except on relatively small scales < 0.5 pc.
Furthermore, we train a convolutional neural network to infer the inclination

active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our detailed 2D decomposition of the surface
brightness distribution in the $Canada$ $France$ $Hawaii$ $Telescope$ ($CFHT$)

source, a bar, a ring, and an inner exponential disk followed by an outer low
surface brightness (LSB) disk. I~Zw~81 turns out to be a disk-dominated galaxy
with lenticular morphology. The modelling of the multi-wavelength spectral
energy distribution (SED) shows that the galaxy is star-forming (SF), and
belongs to the blue cloud. We find that the optical (g$-$r) color of the bar is
bluer than the disks, and the far- and near-ultraviolet emission inside the
galaxy observed with Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard {\em
AstroSat} is concentrated in the central few kpc region enclosing the bar. The
strong bar might be playing a pivotal role in driving the gas inflow and
causing SF activity in tandem with the minor merger-like interactions as
evident from the deep $CFHT$ data. The low-luminosity AGN is insufficient to
quench the central SF. The results are peculiar from the standpoint of a

Variable stars (LPVs), namely asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) and red
supergiant stars (RSGs), to obtain the Star Formation History (SFH) of
isolated, metal-poor SagDIG. For our purpose, we used a method that relies on
evaluating the relation between luminosity and the birth mass of these most
evolved stars. We found $27$ LPV candidates within two half-light radii of
SagDIG. $10$ LPV candidates were in common with previous studies, including one
very dusty AGB (x-AGB). By adopting the metallicity $Z = 0.0002$ for older
population and $Z=0.0004$ for younger ages, we estimated that the star
formation rate changes from $0.0005\pm0.0002$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$
($13$ Gyr ago) to $0.0021 \pm 0.0010$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ ($0.06$

formation activity across its lifetime, though with different rates, and
experiences an enhancement of star formation since $z \simeq 1$. We also
evaluated the total stellar mass within two half-light radii of SagDIG for
three choices of metallicities. For metallicity $Z = 0.0002$ and $Z=0.0004$ we

to be connected, however, the nature of these relations remains unclear. In
this work, we aim to elucidate them by studying the formation of a barred
galaxy in a major merger of two disks in the IllustrisTNG simulations. This
merger involves a coalescence of two supermassive black holes and a sudden
switch to the kinetic mode of AGN feedback implemented in the simulations,
which leads to the removal of the gas from the inner part of the galaxy,
followed by quenching of star formation and the formation of the bar. This
causal relation between AGN feedback and bar formation explains a number of
correlations observed in the data, such as the higher frequency of bars among
red spirals and the presence of central gas holes in barred galaxies. In such a
picture, the bars do not feed the black holes, so their presence does not
increase the AGN strength, and they do not cause quenching. However, bars do
form in regions characterized by a low gas fraction resulting from AGN
feedback. This scenario is probably applicable to many barred galaxies, not

the collisionless $R_{\rm max}$--$V_{\rm max}$ relation can be used to select
deeply core-collapsed halos, where $V_{\rm max}$ is a halo's maximum circular
velocity and $R_{\rm max}$ is the radius at which it occurs. We predict that a
sizable fraction ($\approx 20\%$) of subhalos with masses down to $\approx
10^8~M_{\odot}$ are deeply core-collapsed in our SIDM model. Core-collapsed
systems form $\approx 10\%$ of the total isolated halo population down to the

Tucana dwarf galaxy. Finally, most halos with masses above $\approx

image-based deep learning. We made the first application of this approach in a
systematic search for reionization-era lensed quasars, using data from the Dark
Energy Survey, the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy
Hemisphere Survey, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Our search
method consists of two main parts: (i) pre-selection of the candidates based on
their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using catalog-level photometry and
(ii) relative probabilities calculation of being a lens or some contaminant
utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification. The training
datasets are constructed by painting deflected point-source lights over actual
galaxy images to generate realistic galaxy-quasar lens models, optimized to
find systems with small image separations, i.e., Einstein radii of
$\theta_\mathrm{E} \leq 1$ arcsec. Visual inspection is then performed for
sources with CNN scores of $P_\mathrm{lens} > 0.1$, which led us to obtain 36
newly-selected lens candidates, waiting for spectroscopic confirmation. These
findings show that automated SED modeling and deep learning pipelines,
supported by modest human input, are a promising route for detecting strong
lenses from large catalogs that can overcome the veto limitations of primarily

the bulge of M31 in five far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV)
filters at 1"" spatial resolution. Models for the luminosity distribution of the
bulge are constructed using the UVIT data and the galaxy image-fitting

function the five images and find Sersic indices ($\simeq2.1$ to 2.5) similar
to previous studies but smaller $R_e$ values ($\simeq0.5$ to 0.6 kpc). When the

best-fit. We use an 8-component fit for the FUV 148nm image, which has the
highest sensitivity. The other images (169 to 279 nm) are fit with 4-component
models. The dust lanes in the bulge region are recovered in the residual image

dust lanes show that M31's nuclear spiral is visible in absorption at NUV and
FUV wavelengths. The bulge images show boxy contours in all five UVIT

feedback from both likely propelled the expansion. Recent 3D dust maps are used
to characterize the 3D topology of the entire region, which shows Barnard's

one of the most puzzling scientific phenomena. Despite over a century of

dark matter and MOND, among other theories. Here we report on another
observation that shows tension between the physics of galaxy rotation and its
rotational velocity. We compare the brightness of galaxies, and find that
galaxies that spin in the same direction as the Milky Way have different
brightness than galaxies that spin in the opposite direction. While such
difference in brightness is expected due to Doppler shift, it is expected to be
subtle. The results show that the difference in brightness is large enough to
be detected by Earth-based telescopes. That observed difference corresponds to
physical properties of galaxies with far greater rotational velocity than the
rotational velocity of the Milky Way. The difference is consistent in both the
Northern galactic pole and the Southern galactic pole, and is not observed in
parts of the sky that are perpendicular to the galactic pole. The differences
are observed by several different instruments such DECam, SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and
HST. The observation is also consistent across annotation methods, including
different computer-based methods, manual annotation, or crowdsourcing
annotations through Galaxy Zoo, all show similar results. Another possible
explanation to the observation is parity violation in the large-scale
structure, such that the magnitude of the parity violation was stronger in the
earlier Universe. It can also be linked to other anomalies such as the Ho

observations of local giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We find that as we
increase the strength of the magnetic field, star formation transitions from
unimodal (the baseline case, $\mu=5$, with a single burst of star formation and
Salpeter IMF) to bimodal. This effect is clearest in the most strongly
magnetized GMCs ($\mu=1$): a first burst of star formation with duration,
intensity and IMF comparable to the baseline case, is followed by a second star
formation episode in which only low-mass stars are formed. Overall, due to the
second burst of star formation, the strongly magnetized case results in a
longer star formation period and a higher efficiency of star formation. The
second burst is produced by gas that is not expelled by radiative feedback,
instead remaining trapped in the GMC by the large-scale B-field, producing a
nearly one-dimensional flow of gas along the field lines. The trapped gas has a
turbulent and magnetic topology that differs from that of the first phase and
strongly suppresses gas accretion onto protostellar cores, reducing their

In this pathway, BHs in the large gas disc are expected to encounter one
another, become mutually bound as a BH binary system through interaction with
the gas in the disc and subsequently inspiral through gravitational torques
induced by the local gas until merger. To more precisely determine the
feasibility of this merger pathway, we present the first 3D global hydrodynamic
simulations of both the formation and evolution of a stellar-mass BH binaries
AGN discs with three different AGN disc masses and five different initial
radial separations. These 15 different simulations show that binary capture can
be successful in a range of local gas densities including cases well below that
of a standard radiatively efficient alpha disc, and identify that the majority
of these captured binaries are then subsequently hardened by the surrounding
gas. Both prograde and retrograde binaries are formed in our simulations, which
tend to be slowly hardened by the gas. The eccentricity evolution is found to
depend strongly on the orbital rotation of the binary where prograde binaries
are governed by gravitational torques form their circumbinary mini-disc, with
eccentricities being damped over time, while for retrograde binaries the
eccentricities are excited to >0.9 by accretion torques. In two cases,
retrograde binaries ultimately undergo a close periapsis passage which results
in a merger via gravitational waves after only a few thousand binary orbits.
Thus, the merger timescale for retrograde binaries can be far shorter than the
lifetime of an AGN disc. These simulations support the case that the AGN merger

to compute the emissivity spectral index and look for grain growth as an
evolutionary tracer. The H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio is anticorrelated with the
deuterium fraction of HCN, thus it can readily serve as a proxy for the
temperature. The spectral index $(\beta\sim 1.34-2.09)$ shows a tentative
anticorrelation with the H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C ratio, suggesting grain growth

star formation as angular momentum transport and outflow driving, which control
circumstellar disc formation/fragmentation and also the star formation
efficiency. While only a much weaker field has been believed to exist in the
early universe, recent theoretical studies find that strong fields can be
generated by turbulent dynamo during the gravitational collapse. Here, we
investigate the gravitational collapse of a cloud core ($\sim 10^{3}\ \rm
cm^{-3}$) up to protostar formation ($\sim 10^{20}\ \rm cm^{-3}$) by non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations considering ambipolar diffusion (AD),
the dominant non-ideal effects in the primordial-gas. We systematically study
rotating cloud cores either with or without turbulence and permeated with
uniform fields of different strengths. We find that AD can slightly suppress
the field growth by dynamo especially on scales smaller than the Jeans-scale at
the density range $10^{10}-10^{14}\ \rm cm^{-3}$, while we could not see the AD
effect on the temperature evolution, since the AD heating rate is always
smaller than compression heating. The inefficiency of AD makes the field as
strong as $10^{3}-10^{5} \rm\ G$ near the formed protostar, much stronger than
in the present-day cases, even in cases with initially weak fields. The
magnetic field affects the inflow motion when amplified to the equipartition
level with turbulence on the Jeans-scale, although disturbed fields do not
launch winds. This might suggest that dynamo amplified fields have smaller
impact on the dynamics in the later accretion phase than other processes such
as ionisation feedback.",0.123837486,-0.2558671,-0.102885425,A

the majority of their ``missing baryons''. Until now, most semi-analytic models
of galaxy formation have paid little attention to hot gaseous haloes and their
X-ray emission. In this paper, we adopt the one-dimensional model from Sharma
et al. instead of the isothermal sphere to describe the radial distribution of
hot gas in the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model. The hot gas halo can be divided
into two parts according to the ratio of the local thermal instability
time-scale and the free-fall time-scale: a cool core with $t_{\rm TI}/t_{\rm
ff}=10$ and a stable outer halo with $t_{\rm TI}/t_{\rm ff}>10$. We update the
prescriptions of cooling, feedback and stripping based on the new hot gas
profiles, and then reproduce several X-ray observational results, like the
radial profiles of hot gas density, and the scaling relations of X-ray
luminosity and temperature. We find: (1) Consistent with observations, flatter
density profiles in halo centers produce lower X-ray emission than an
isothermal sphere; (2) Cool core regions prone to precipitation have higher gas
temperature than the virial temperature, and a larger $T_{\rm X}/T_{\rm 200}$
ratio in smaller haloes leads to a steeper slope in the $L_{\rm X}-T_{\rm X}$
relation; (3) The ionized gas in the unbounded reservoir and low temperature
intergalactic gas in low mass haloes could be the main components of the halo
``missing baryons''. Our model outputs can predict the observations of hot gas
in the nearby universe and produce mock surveys of baryons probed by future
X-ray telescopes.",-0.18650389,-0.06269607,-0.05389703,C

promising tool for measuring the properties of the PAH population and their
effect on star formation. The photometric bands of the MIRI and NIRCam
instruments on JWST provide the opportunity to measure PAH emission features

present the first results of this analysis in a sample of three nearby
galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Based on the variations observed in
the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\mu$m features, we infer changes to the average PAH
size and ionization state across the different galaxy environments. High values
of F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W and low values of F1130W/F770W are measured in H II
regions in all three galaxies. This suggests that these regions are populated
by hotter PAHs, and/or that the PAH ionization fraction is larger. We see
additional evidence of heating and/or changes in PAH size in regions with
higher molecular gas content as well as increased ionization in regions with
higher H$\alpha$ intensity.",0.20031609,0.1517452,0.13417666,B
