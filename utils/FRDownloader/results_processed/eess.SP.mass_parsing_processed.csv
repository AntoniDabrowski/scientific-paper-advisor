driven by the ever-increasing user demands, reduced costs, and technological

Satellite Communication Systems (SCSs), we aim for filling this knowledge gap.
Specifically, we critically appraise the inherent characteristics of LEO SCSs
and summarize their unique security vulnerabilities. In light of this, we
further discuss their security vulnerabilities, including the issues of passive
and active eavesdropping attacks, interference scenarios, single event upsets,
and space debris. Subsequently, we discuss the corresponding active and passive
security countermeasures, followed by unveiling a range of trade-offs, security
vulnerabilities and their countermeasures. Furthermore, we shed light on
several promising future research directions for enhancing the security of LEO

intelligent reflecting surface enabled secure transmission. Finally, the

a methodology for budgeting significant sources of error and uncertainty during

optimizing the GN's transmit power, the IRS's passive beamforming and the UAV's
trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the
non-convex objective function and the coupled optimization variables. Thus, to
tackle it, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by
exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm can significantly improve the average rate compared with the
benchmark algorithms. Moreover, it also shows that when the jamming power is
large and the number of IRS elements is relatively small, deploying the IRS
near the jammer outperforms deploying it near the GN, and vice versa.",-0.38610867,0.08144523,0.013585385,C

access points (APs) can collaboratively conduct transmitter beamforming to
provide data services (e.g., eMBB or URLLC). The collaboration between APs
effectively forms a networked linear antenna-array with extra-large aperture
(i.e., network-ELAA), where the wireless channel exhibits spatial
nonstationarity. Major contribution of this work lies in the analysis of
beamforming gain and radio coverage for network-ELAA non-stationary Rician
channels considering the AP clustering. Assuming that: 1) the total
transmit-power is fixed and evenly distributed over APs, 2) the beam is formed
only based on the line-of-sight (LoS) path, it is found that the beamforming
gain is concave to the cluster size. The optimum size of the AP cluster varies
with respect to the user's location, channel uncertainty as well as data
services. A user located farther from the ELAA requires a larger cluster size.
URLLC is more sensitive to the channel uncertainty when comparing to eMBB, thus
requiring a larger cluster size to mitigate the channel fading effect and
extend the coverage. Finally, it is shown that the network-ELAA can offer
significant coverage extension (50% or more in most of cases) when comparing

difference of two pulsed beams (10 kHz) is successfully compensated to zero in

framework for the design of acoustic coatings for underwater sound attenuation
through integrating Machine Learning (ML) and statistical optimization
algorithms with a Finite Element Model (FEM). The finite element models were
developed to simulate the realistic performance of the acoustic coatings based
on polyurethane (PU) elastomers with embedded cylindrical voids. The FEM
results revealed that the frequency-dependent viscoelastic behavior of the
polyurethane matrix has a significant impact on the magnitude and frequency of
the absorption peak associated with the cylinders at low frequencies, which has
been commonly ignored in previous studies on similar systems. The data
generated from the FEM was used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to
accelerate the design process, and subsequently, was integrated with a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal geometric parameters of the cylinders
to achieve maximized, broadband, low-frequency waterborne sound attenuation. A
significant, broadband, low-frequency attenuation is achieved by optimally
configuring the layers of cylindrical voids and using attenuation mechanisms,
including Fabry-P\'erot resonance and Bragg scattering of the layers of voids.
Integration of the machine learning technique into the optimization algorithm
further accelerated the exploration of the high dimensional design space for
the targeted performance. The developed DNN exhibited significantly increased
speed (by a factor of $4.5\times 10^3$ ) in predicting the absorption
coefficient compared to the conventional FEM(s). Therefore, the acceleration
brought by the materials informatics framework brings a paradigm shift to the

performance due to the least separable margin among the movements possessing
weak signal strengths. To meet these challenges, two time-domain features based
on nonlinear scaling, the log of the mean absolute value (LMAV) and the
nonlinear scaled value (NSV), are proposed. In this study, we validate the
proposed features on two datasets, existing four feature extraction methods,
variable window size and various signal to noise ratios (SNR). In addition, we
also propose a feature extraction method where the LMAV and NSV are grouped
with the existing 11 time-domain features. The proposed feature extraction
method enhances accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score by
1.00%, 5.01%, 0.55%, 4.71%, and 5.06% for dataset 1, and 1.18%, 5.90%, 0.66%,

automate it. The fundamental features of most of these techniques are electro

worldwide, deep learning (DL) algorithms-based electroencephalograph (EEG)
analysis provides the possibility for accurate epileptic seizure (ES)
prediction, thereby benefiting patients suffering from epilepsy. To identify
the preictal region that precedes the onset of seizure, a large number of
annotated EEG signals are required to train DL algorithms. However, the
scarcity of seizure onsets leads to significant insufficiency of data for
training the DL algorithms. To overcome this data insufficiency, in this paper,
we propose a preictal artificial signal synthesis algorithm based on a
generative adversarial network to generate synthetic multichannel EEG preictal
samples. A high-quality single-channel architecture, determined by visual and
statistical evaluations, is used to train the generators of multichannel
samples. The effectiveness of the synthetic samples is evaluated by comparing
the ES prediction performances without and with synthetic preictal sample
augmentation. The leave-one-seizure-out cross validation ES prediction accuracy

propagation channel modeling is essential to understand the spectrum and to
develop reliable communication systems in these bands. Ray tracing and
traditional statistical modeling are insufficient to construct a suitable
channel model due to the wide bandwidth and rapid changes in the
characteristics of THz channels. In this work, we propose the utilization of
hierarchical Dirichlet Process Gamma Mixture Model (DPGMM) to characterize THz
channels statistically in the absence of any prior knowledge. DPGMM provides
mixture component parameters and the required number of components. A revised
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is also proposed as a pre-step for
DPGMM. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-divergence) is utilized as an error
metric to examine the amount of inaccuracy of the EM algorithm and DPGMM when
modeling the experimental probability density functions (PDFs). DPGMM and EM
algorithm are implemented over the measurements taken at frequencies between
240 GHz and 300 GHz. By comparing the results of the DPGMM and EM algorithms
for the measurement datasets, we demonstrate how well the DPGMM fits the target
distribution. It is shown that the proposed DPGMM can accurately describe the
various THz channels as good as the EM algorithm, and its flexibility allows it
to represent more complex distributions better than the EM algorithm. We also
demonstrated that DPGMM can be used to model any wireless channel due to its

acoustic signals is worse than of using acceleration signals. However, it can

The external environment and mobility context have an impact on walking

episodes is the ability to detect the context within which those episodes
occurred. The primary goal of this paper is the investigation of context
detection for remote monitoring of daily motor functions. We aim to understand
whether inertial signals sampled with wearable accelerometers, provide reliable
information to classify gait-related activities as either indoor or outdoor. We
explore two different approaches to this task: (1) using gait descriptors and
features extracted from the input inertial signals sampled during walking
episodes, together with classic machine learning algorithms, and (2) treating
the input inertial signals as time series data and leveraging end-to-end
state-of-the-art time series classifiers. We directly compare the two
approaches through a set of experiments based on data collected from 9 healthy

hierarchical structure) and other deep learning models (LSTM, CLDNN). It can be
seen although the time and space complexity of these algorithms have increased,
different deep learning models have different effects on the modulation

optical-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM) and O-OFDM with
index modulation (O-OFDM-IM) for optical wireless systems. Both schemes
individually have some limitations, e.g., O-OFDM does not provide any
granularity for spectral efficiency (SE)/energy efficiency (EE) trade-off, and
O-OFDM-IM loses EE for higher order modulation alphabets. By combining O-OFDM
and O-OFDM-IM together, the above limitations can be circumvented. Following on
from providing the general framework, we use asymmetrically clipped (AC)O-OFDM
and ACO-OFDM-IM to demonstrate the validity of the framework. The results
presented herein establish that, by consolidating O-OFDM and O-OFDM-IM, in
addition to providing SE/EE trade-off, we may realise higher SE and outperform
O-OFDM-IM in terms of EE for high SE.",-0.29541087,0.11359324,0.057499122,C

geometry, also referred to as the geometric detector, has been developed
speedily and exhibits distinct advantages in several practical applications.
These advantages benefit from the geometry of the Toeplitz Hermitian positive
definite (HPD) manifold $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, but the
sophisticated geometry also results in some challenges for geometric detectors,
such as the implementation of the enhanced detector to improve the SCR
(signal-to-clutter ratio) and the analysis of the detection performance. To
meet these challenges, this paper develops the dual power spectrum manifold
$\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$ as the dual space of
$\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$. For each affine invariant geometric measure
on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, we show that there exists an equivalent
function named induced potential function on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$. By the
induced potential function, the measurements of the dissimilarity between two
matrices can be implemented on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$, and the geometric
detectors can be reformulated as the form related to the power spectrum. The
induced potential function leads to two contributions: 1) The enhancement of
the geometric detector, which is formulated as an optimization problem
concerning $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{T}H_{++}}$, is transformed to an equivalent
and simpler optimization on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$. In the presented example
of the enhancement, the closed-form solution, instead of the gradient descent
method, is provided through the equivalent optimization. 2) The detection
performance is analyzed based on $\mathcal{M}_{\text{P}}$, and the advantageous
characteristics, which benefit the detection performance, can be deduced by
analyzing the corresponding power spectrum to the maximal point of the induced
potential function.",0.043797985,-0.29164055,0.16228381,B

and frequency downconversion approach for in-band full-duplex (IBFD)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with adaptive digital amplitude
and delay pre-matching is proposed based on a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder
modulator (DP-MZM). In each MIMO receiving antenna, the received signal,
including different SI signals from different transmitting antennas and the
signal of interest, is applied to one arm of the upper dual-drive Mach-ehnder
modulator (DD-MZM) of the DP-MZM, the reference signal is applied to the other
arm of the upper DD-MZM, and the local oscillator signal is applied to the
lower DD-MZM. The SI signals are canceled in the optical domain in the upper
DD-MZM and the frequency downconversion is achieved after photodetection. To
cancel the SI signals, the reference signal is constructed in the digital
domain, while the amplitude and delay of the constructed reference are adjusted
digitally by upsampling with high accuracy. Experiments are performed when two
different SI signals are employed. The genetic algorithm and least-squares
algorithm are combined with segmented searching respectively for the SI signal
reconstruction and amplitude and delay pre-matching. A cancellation depth of
around 20 dB is achieved for the 1-Gbaud 16 quadrature-amplitude modulation

analyzed and the accuracy and resolution limitation in the fast sweep scenario
is broken by broadening the filter bandwidth. It is found that when the sweep
speed is very fast, the width of the generated pulse via FTTM is mainly
determined by the impulse response of the filter. In this case, appropriately
increasing the filter bandwidth can significantly reduce the pulse width, so as
to improve the measurement accuracy and resolution. FTTM-based short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) and microwave frequency measurement using the
stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) effect is demonstrated by comparing the
results with and without SBS gain spectrum broadening and the improvement of

time series into relevant phenomenological components. A given measurement is
typically assumed to be an additive mixture of myriad signals plus noise whose
separation forms an ill-posed inverse problem. In the setting of sensing
elastic objects using active sonar, we wish to separate the early-time returns
(e.g., returns from the object's exterior geometry) from late-time returns
caused by elastic or compressional wave coupling.
  Under the framework of Morphological Component Analysis (MCA), we compare two
separation models using the short-duration and long-duration responses as a
proxy for early-time and late-time returns. Results are computed for Stanton's
elastic cylinder model as well as on experimental data taken from an in-Air
circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (AirSAS) system, whose separated time series
are formed into imagery. We find that MCA can be used to separate early and
late-time responses in both cases without the use of time-gating. The
separation process is demonstrated to be robust to noise and compatible with
AirSAS image reconstruction. The best separation results are obtained with a
flexible, but computationally intensive, frame based signal model, while a
faster Fourier Transform based method is shown to have competitive performance.",0.13890481,-0.27671525,0.02808255,B

techniques as well as modern day deep learning methods have been applied with
promising results. In this paper we present EEG-BBNet, a hybrid network which
integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) with graph convolutional neural
networks (GCNN). The benefit of the CNN in automatic feature extraction and the
capability of GCNN in learning connectivity between EEG electrodes through
graph representation are jointly exploited. We examine various connectivity
measures, namely the Euclidean distance, Pearson's correlation coefficient,
phase-locked value, phase-lag index, and Rho index. The performance of the
proposed method is assessed on a benchmark dataset consisting of various
brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks and compared to other state-of-the-art
approaches. We found that our models outperform all baselines in the
event-related potential (ERP) task with an average correct recognition rates up
to 99.26% using intra-session data. EEG-BBNet with Pearson's correlation and
RHO index provide the best classification results. In addition, our model
demonstrates greater adaptability using inter-session and inter-task data. We
also investigate the practicality of our proposed model with smaller number of
electrodes. Electrode placements over the frontal lobe region appears to be
most appropriate with minimal lost in performance.",0.42964378,0.06645992,0.029480115,A

information. Different ray launching methods are compared to obtain a better
launching method. By using equiangular division, rays are launched more
uniformly from transmitter (Tx) compared with the current equidistant division
method. With the proposed iterative precise algorithm, error of angle of
departure (AOD) and angle of arrival (AOA) is below 0.01 degree. The
relationship between the number of iterations and error reduction is also

detection performance using a heterogeneous set of ML algorithms is missing in
the literature. Last, it is needed to study the detection performance of
scalable ML models suitable for groups of subjects and compare it with the
individual models proposed in the literature. To improve these limitations,
this work presents an intelligent framework that employs BCIs and features

Support Vector Machine (SVM). Concerning scalable models, RF reached a 79%

learned can be summarized as follows: i) not only SVM but also other models not

cost and power constraints exist, the use of high-precision ADCs is not
feasible and the designer must resort to ADCs with coarse quantization.
Consequently the interest in the topic of signal parameter estimation from
quantized data has increased significantly in recent years. The Cramer-Rao
bound (CRB) is an important yardstick in any parameter estimation problem.
Indeed it lower bounds the variance of any unbiased parameter estimator.
Moreover, the CRB is an achievable limit, for instance it is asymptotically
attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (under regularity conditions), and
thus it is a useful benchmark to which the accuracy of any parameter estimator
can and should be compared. A formula for the CRB for signal parameter
estimation from real-valued quantized data has been presented in but its
derivation was somewhat sketchy. The said CRB formula has been extended for
instance in to complex-valued quantized data, but again its derivation was
rather sketchy. The special case of binary (1-bit) ADCs and a signal consisting
of one sinusoid has been thoroughly analyzed in . The CRB formula for a binary
ADC and a general real-valued signal has been derived.",0.02551715,-0.1308248,0.17417663,B

adopted in the integrated multi-media system. Specifically, the messages of
devices using heterogeneous propagation media, are firstly transmitted to the
medium-matched AP, with the aid of the RIS-based dual-hop transmission. After
the operation of intermediate frequency conversion, the access point (AP)
uploads the received signals to the cloud for further demodulating and decoding
process. Based on time division multiple access (TDMA), the cloud is able to
distinguish the downlink data transmitted to different devices and transforms
them into the input of the RIS controller via the dedicated control channel.
Thereby, the RIS can passively reflect the incident carrier back into the
original receiver with the exchanged information during the preallocated slots,
following the idea of an index modulation-based transmitter. Moreover, the
iterative optimization algorithm is utilized for optimizing the RIS phase,
