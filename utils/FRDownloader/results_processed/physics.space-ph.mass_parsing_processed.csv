Higgins')]","A propulsion concept in which a spacecraft interacts with high-velocity
pellets and the interstellar medium is proposed. The pellets are slower than
the spacecraft and are accelerated backwards as they are overtaken, imparting a
forward acceleration on the spacecraft. This maneuver is possible due to the
interaction with a fixed medium (interstellar medium, ISM); as the spacecraft
travels through the medium, it is able to extract power from the relative wind.
This concept relies upon the relative velocities (shear) between the pellet
stream and the fixed medium in order to concentrate the energy of the pellets
into the spacecraft and is thus termed wind-pellet shear sailing. The equations
governing the mass ratio of pellets to the spacecraft and its dependence on the
final spacecraft velocity are derived; the critical role of the efficiency of
the power extraction and transfer process is identified. Natural sources of
energy are considered as a means to accelerate the pellets to velocities of
1000 to 6000 km/s. Techniques for onboard generation of power via
electromagnetic interaction with the ISM are reviewed, with a repetitively
stroked plasma magnet being identified as a promising approach. The necessity
of the spacecraft to detect and track the pellets as they are overtaken
dictates the desired properties of the pellets. Pellet pushers (accelerators)
on board the spacecraft are also preliminarily explored in their engineering
considerations, with electric field accelerators of charged nanometric
particles, Lorentz-force accelerated ionized pellets, or expansion of vaporized
pellets via a nozzle being highlighted as potential approaches. A preliminary

Bunting'), arxiv.Result.Author('Huw Morgan')]","Accurate forecasting of the solar wind has grown in importance as society
becomes increasingly dependent on technology that is susceptible to space
weather events. This work describes an inner boundary condition for ambient
solar wind models based on tomography maps of the coronal plasma density gained
from coronagraph observations, providing a novel alternative to magnetic
extrapolations. The tomographical density maps provide a direct constraint of
the coronal structure at heliocentric distances of 4 to 8Rs, thus avoiding the
need to model the complex non-radial lower corona. An empirical inverse
relationship converts densities to solar wind velocities which are used as an
inner boundary condition by the Heliospheric Upwind Extrapolation (HUXt) model
to give ambient solar wind velocity at Earth. The dynamic time warping (DTW)
algorithm is used to quantify the agreement between tomography/HUXt output and
in situ data. An exhaustive search method is then used to adjust the lower
boundary velocity range in order to optimize the model. Early results show up
to a 32% decrease in mean absolute error between the modelled and observed
solar wind velocities compared to that of the coupled MAS/HUXt model. The use
of density maps gained from tomography as an inner boundary constraint is thus
a valid alternative to coronal magnetic models, and offers a significant
advancement in the field given the availability of routine space-based
coronagraph observations.",0.34225968,-0.3238843,0.08005608,C

wave-driven energetic electron precipitation using data from the energetic
electron detector on the Electron Losses and Fields InvestigatioN (ELFIN)
mission, two polar-orbiting low-altitude spinning CubeSats, measuring 50-5000
keV electrons with good pitch-angle and energy resolution. EMIC wave-driven
precipitation exhibits a distinct signature in energy-spectrograms of the
precipitating-to-trapped flux ratio: peaks at 0.5 MeV which are abrupt (bursty)
with significant substructure (occasionally down to sub-second timescale).
Multiple ELFIN passes over the same MLT sector allow us to study the spatial
and temporal evolution of the EMIC wave - electron interaction region. Using
two years of ELFIN data, we assemble a statistical database of 50 events of
strong EMIC wave-driven precipitation. Most reside at L=5-7 at dusk, while a
smaller subset exists at L=8-12 at post-midnight. The energies of the
peak-precipitation ratio and of the half-peak precipitation ratio (our proxy
for the minimum resonance energy) exhibit an L-shell dependence in good
agreement with theoretical estimates based on prior statistical observations of
EMIC wave power spectra. The precipitation ratio's spectral shape for the most
intense events has an exponential falloff away from the peak (i.e., on either
side of 1.45 MeV). It too agrees well with quasi-linear diffusion theory based
on prior statistics of wave spectra. Sub-MeV electron precipitation observed
concurrently with strong EMIC wave-driven 1MeV precipitation has a spectral
shape that is consistent with efficient pitch-angle scattering down to 200-300
keV by much less intense higher frequency EMIC waves. These results confirm the
critical role of EMIC waves in driving relativistic electron losses. Nonlinear
effects may abound and require further investigation.",0.13577351,-0.23749,-0.4011442,C
