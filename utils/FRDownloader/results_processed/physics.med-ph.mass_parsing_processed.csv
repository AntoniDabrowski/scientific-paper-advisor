damage and damage saturation to tumour control obtained with SBRT/SRS
treatments for early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases. Methods and Materials:
We have constructed a dataset of early-stage NSCLC and brain metastases
dose-response. These data were fitted to models based on the linear-quadratic
(LQ), the linear-quadratic-linear (LQL), and phenomenological modifications of
the LQ-model to account for indirect cell damage. We use the
Akaike-Information-Criterion formalism to compare performance, and studied the
stability of the results with changes in fitting parameters and perturbations
on dose/TCP values.
  Results: In NSCLC, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term increasing with dose
yields the best-fits for $\alpha$/$\beta$=10 Gy. Only the inclusion of very
fast accelerated proliferation or low $\alpha$/$\beta$ values can eliminate
such superiority. In brain, the LQL model yields the best-fits, and the ranking
is not affected by variations of fitting parameters or dose/TCP perturbations.
  Conclusions: For $\alpha$/$\beta$=10 Gy, a modified LQ-model with a beta-term
increasing with dose provides better fits to NSCLC dose-response curves. For
brain metastases, the LQL provides the best fit. This might be interpreted as a
hint of indirect damage in NSCLC, and damage saturation in brain metastases.
The results for NSCLC are strongly dependent on the value of $\alpha$/$\beta$
and may require further investigation, while those for brain seem to be clearly
significant. Our results can assist in the design of improved radiotherapy for
NSCLC and brain metastases, aiming at avoiding over/under-treatment.",-0.26395738,-0.30941916,0.22344534,A

deep learning models have been used to detect these diseases. However, such

is computed by using a local frequency estimator to measure the three
dimensional local wavelengths of a steady-state shear wave within the prostate

transmits multi-frequency vibrations transperineally. Radio frequency data is
streamed directly from a BK Medical 8848 trans-rectal ultrasound transducer to
an external computer where tissue displacement due to the excitation is
measured using a speckle tracking algorithm. Bandpass sampling is used that
eliminates the need for an ultra fast frame rate to track the tissue motion and
allows for accurate reconstruction at a sampling frequency that is below the
Nyquist rate. A roll motor with computer control is used to rotate the sagittal
array of the transducer and obtain the 3D data. Two CIRS phantoms were used to
validate both the accuracy of the elasticity measurement as well as the
functional feasibility of using the system for in vivo prostate imaging. The
system has been used in two separate clinical studies as a method for cancer
identification. The results, presented here, show numerical and visual

Carter'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas J. Fuchs'), arxiv.Result.Author('Adam L. Kesner')]","AIMS: Clinical radiographic imaging is seated upon the principle of
differential keV photon transmission through an object. At clinical x-ray
energies the scattering of photons causes signal noise and is utilized solely
for transmission measurements. However, scatter - particularly Compton scatter,
is characterizable. In this work we hypothesized that modern radiation sources
and detectors paired with deep learning techniques can use scattered photon
information constructively to resolve superimposed attenuators in planar x-ray
imaging. METHODS: We simulated a monoenergetic x-ray imaging system consisting
of a pencil beam x-ray source directed at an imaging target positioned in front
of a high spatial- and energy-resolution detector array. The signal was
analyzed by a convolutional neural network, and a description of scattering
material along the axis of the beam was derived. The system was virtually
designed/tested using Monte Carlo processing of simple phantoms consisting of
10 pseudo-randomly stacked air/bone/water materials, and the network was
trained by solving a classification problem. RESULTS: The average accuracy of
the material identification along the beam was 0.91 +- 0.01, with slightly
higher accuracy towards the entrance/exit peripheral surfaces of the object.
The average sensitivity and specificity was 0.91 and 0.95, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides proof of principle that deep learning techniques
can be used to analyze scattered photon patterns which can constructively
contribute to the information content in radiography, here used to infer depth
information in a traditional 2D planar setup. This principle, and our results,
demonstrate that the information in Compton scattered photons may provide a
basis for further development. The ability to scale performance to the clinic

Schiffner')],"Ultrafast imaging modes, such as coherent plane-wave compounding (CPWC),
capture a large field of view in a single pulse-echo measurement using parallel
receive focusing. The number of foci or, equivalently, the number of volume
elements (voxels) in the image determines the computational costs and the
memory consumption of the image formation. Herein, 120{\deg} rhombic grids are
proposed to specify the voxel positions and reduce the number of voxels in
comparison to orthogonal grids. The proposed grids derive from the bivariate
sampling theorem and the spectral properties of the images formed by the
delay-and-sum algorithm in CPWC. A phantom experiment validated the proposed
grids and showed reductions in the number of voxels by 81.4 % and 14.7 % in
comparison to the usual and optimal orthogonal grids, respectively. Mean
structural similarity indices above 96.6 % and relative root mean-squared
errors below 6.8 % confirmed the visual equivalence of all images after
interpolations to the usual orthogonal grid.",0.8340294,0.05238195,0.17264196,B

evolving virtual staining field, also shedding light on areas that need further research effort.","We group these approaches into (i) label-free virtual staining (Table 1) and (ii)
stain-to-stain transformations (Table 2), where the former computationally generates the virtual
histological images from label-free images captured using unstained samples, and the latter digitally
transforms the images of already stained tissue samples (e.g., H&E-stained) into other types of stains
(e.g., MT and IHC).","We believe

pathology and life-science research, which visualizes the tissue and cellular
structures using chromatic dyes or fluorescence labels to aid the microscopic
assessment of tissue. However, the current histological staining workflow
requires tedious sample preparation steps, specialized laboratory
infrastructure, and trained histotechnologists, making it expensive,
time-consuming, and not accessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning
techniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by
digitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks,
providing rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical
staining methods. These techniques, broadly referred to as virtual staining,
were extensively explored by multiple research groups and demonstrated to be
successful in generating various types of histological stains from label-free
microscopic images of unstained samples; similar approaches were also used for
transforming images of an already stained tissue sample into another type of
stain, performing virtual stain-to-stain transformations. In this Review, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research advances in deep
learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques. The basic concepts
and the typical workflow of virtual staining are introduced, followed by a
discussion of representative works and their technical innovations. We also
share our perspectives on the future of this emerging field, aiming to inspire
readers from diverse scientific fields to further expand the scope of deep
learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques and their
applications.",-0.05302248,-0.238738,-0.38014114,A

seasons and geographical locations.","We considered this change in peak force to be relatively
small compared to other, previously tested foams intended for use in American football helmets.37
We did not perform full helmet testing across a range of temperatures, as the results would have
likely been influenced by the sensitivity of the helmet’s performance to changes in temperature;
therefore, it remains unclear how these changes in peak force would translate to changes in brain
injury risk.","Overall, results of our laboratory impact testing suggested significant reduction of angular
