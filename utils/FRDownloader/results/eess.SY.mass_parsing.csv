with 2D group-III phosphides: AlP and GaP. The planar structure of AlP and
low-buckled GaP have been taken to form the bilayer patterns. In each case,
three stacking patterns are considered, and their relaxed interlayer distance
and binding energy have been reported. The binding energy being around in the
range between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals
interactions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and
these two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude
range of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer
distance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain. Although
their normal bandgap, which significantly changes with SOC, is an indirect one,
whilst tunning the interlayer distance band gap jumps from unsymmetrical point
to symmetrical Dirac cones and becomes direct on K points. The charge carrier
mostly concentrates on the p-orbitals of the germanene in the conduction
regions; thus, the electrical properties of germanene will be retained, and the
carrier will provide a much faster device response property. The absence of the
phosphides influence makes them the intended substrate for growing the
germanene layer on top of that. Again, due to the bandgap at Dirac cones being
opened and jumps between the Dirac cones and band gap changes with SOC
tropological insulator can be formed, and Quantum Spin Hall effect may exist."

applications due to its ability to handle multi-input multi-output systems with
physical constraints. The optimization solvers require considerable time,
limiting their embedded implementation for real-time control. To overcome the
bottleneck of traditional quadratic programming (QP) solvers, this paper
proposes a robust penalty method (RPM) to solve an optimization problem in a
linear MPC. The main idea of RPM is to solve an unconstrained QP problem using
Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (BFGS) algorithm. The beauty of this method
is that it can find optimal solutions even if initial conditions are in an
infeasible region, which makes it robust. Moreover, the RPM is computationally
inexpensive as compared to the traditional QP solvers. The proposed RPM is
implemented on resource-limited embedded hardware (STM32 microcontroller), and
its performance is validated with a case study of a citation aircraft control
problem. We show the hardware-in-the-loop co-simulation results of the proposed
RPM and compared them with the active set method (ASM) and interior point
method (IPM) QP solvers. The performance of MPC with the aforementioned solvers
is compared by considering the optimality, time complexity, and ease of
hardware implementation. Presented results show that the proposed RPM gives the
same optimality as ASM and IPM, and outperforms them in terms of speed."

distributed adaptive control algorithms for linearly parameterized multi-agent

convergent. Finally, two comparative numerical simulation examples are carried
out to verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach

Synchronous Generators (VSGs) are proposed to compensate the reducing inertia

surprisingly find that instabilities of a small-signal nature could arise
despite fairly high system inertia. Importantly, we show there exist both an
optimal and a maximum number of such VSGs that can be safely supported, a
previously unknown result directly useful for power utilities in long-term
planning and prosumer contracting. Meanwhile, to resolve instabilities in the
short term, we argue that the new market should include another commodity that
we call stability storage, whereby -- analogous to energy storage buffering
energy imbalances -- VSGs act as decentralized stability buffers. While
demonstrating the effectiveness of this concept for a wide range of energy

paper describes the operational and societal benefits of SRSWL as well as

flexibility in assigning travelers to pickup and drop-off locations. The paper
also discusses four modelling challenge: short-distance person trips, drop-off
location choice for a vehicle's last remaining passenger, allowing vehicles to
wait for travelers at pickup locations, and simultaneously reducing VHT/VKT and
improving customer service quality relative to D2D shared-ride services. The
review paper concludes by discussing the most critical areas of future research

systems manage errors and failures by identifying particular events caused by
failure and then mitigate the effect of that failure as much as possible. These
systems have become prominent due to their smooth and autonomous way of
detecting and minimizing risk in any system. The input to state stability

distributed energy resources at the edge of the electricity grid, based on a
systematic analysis of key literature trends. The coordination of distributed
energy resources such as decentralised generation and flexibility sources is
critical for decarbonising electricity and achieving climate goals. The
literature on the topic is growing exponentially; however, there is ambiguity
in the terminology used to date. We seek to resolve this lack of clarity by
synthesising the categories of coordination strategies in a novel exhaustive,
mutually exclusive taxonomy based on agency, information and game type. The
relevance of these concepts in the literature is illustrated through a
systematic literature review of 84,741 publications using a structured topic
search query. Then 93 selected coordination strategies are analysed in more
detail and mapped onto this framework. Clarity on structural assumptions is key
for selecting appropriate coordination strategies for differing contexts within
energy systems. We argue that a plurality of complementary strategies is needed
to coordinate energy systems' different components and achieve deep
decarbonisation."

supermarket refrigeration systems, it is important to determine the heat demand
of the cabinets. This can easily be achieved by measuring the mass flow through
each cabinet, however, that is expensive and not feasible in large-scale
deployments. Therefore it is important to be able to estimate the valve sizes
from the monitoring data, which is typically measured. The valve size is
measured by an area, which can be used to calculate mass flow through the valve
-- this estimated value is referred to as the valve constant. A novel method
for estimating the cabinet evaporator valve constants is proposed in the
present paper. It is demonstrated using monitoring data from a refrigeration
system in a supermarket consisting of data sampled at a one-minute sampling
rate, however it is shown that a sampling time of around 10-20 minutes is
adequate for the method. Through thermodynamic analysis of a two-stage CO2
refrigeration system, a linear regression model for estimating valve constants
was developed using time series data. The linear regression requires that
transient dynamics are not present in the data, which depends on multiple
factors e.g. the sampling time. If dynamics are not modeled it can be detected
by a significant auto-correlation of the residuals. In order to include the
dynamics in the model, an Auto-Regressive Moving Average model with eXogenous
variables (ARMAX) was applied, and it is shown how it effectively eliminates
the auto-correlation and provides more unbiased estimates, as well as improved
the accuracy estimates. Furthermore, it is shown that the sample time has a
huge impact on the valve estimates. Thus, a method for selecting the optimal
sampling time is introduced. It works individually for each of the evaporators,
by exploring their respective frequency spectrum."

transmission system behavior, has been studied for decades. Despite a variety
of available methods, existing PLF approaches rarely take system control into
account. However, system control, as an automatic buffer between the
fluctuations in random variables and the variations in system states, has a
significant impact on the final PLF result. To consider control actions'
influence, this paper proposes the first analytical PLF method for the
transmission grid that takes into account primary and secondary frequency
controls. This method is based on a high-precision linear power flow model,
whose precision is even further improved in this paper by an original
correction approach. This paper also proves that if the joint probability
distribution (JPD) of random variables is expressed by a Gaussian mixture model
(GMM), then the JPD of system states (e.g., nodal voltages) is an infinite GMM.
By leveraging this proposition, the proposed method can generate the joint PLF
of the whole system, is applicable to random variables obeying any
distributions, and is capable of capturing their correlation. The high accuracy
and satisfactory efficiency of this method are verified on test cases scaling

trades efficiency and throughput gains for dynamic-range limitations, raising
distinct challenges for training, where compute precision requirements are seen

on IMC hardware by leveraging two recent developments: (1) a training algorithm
enabling aggressive quantization through a radix-4 number representation; (2)
IMC leveraging compute based on precision capacitors, whereby analog noise
effects can be made well below quantization effects. Energy modeling calibrated

in recent years. Different from the previous urban distribution mode that
depends on trucks, this paper proposes a novel package pick-up and delivery
mode and system in which multiple drones collaborate with automatic devices.
The proposed mode uses free areas on the top of residential buildings to set
automatic devices as delivery and pick-up points of packages, and employs
drones to transport packages between buildings and depots. Integrated
scheduling problem of package drop-pickup considering m-drone, m-depot,
m-customer is crucial for the system. We propose a simulated-annealing-based
two-phase optimization approach (SATO) to solve this problem. In the first
phase, tasks are allocated to depots for serving, such that the initial problem
is decomposed into multiple single depot scheduling problems with m-drone. In
the second phase, considering the drone capability constraints and task demand
constraints, we generate the route planning scheme for drones in each depot.
Concurrently, an improved variable neighborhood descent algorithm (IVND) is
designed in the first phase to reallocate tasks, and a local search algorithm
(LS) are proposed to search the high-quality solution in the second phase.
Finally, extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted to test
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experiments indicate that the
proposed SATO-IVND can reduce the cost by more than 14% in a reasonable time

network, where multiple sensors are deployed to infer the state of a linear
time-invariant (LTI) Gaussian system. By proposing a lossless decomposition of
Kalman filter, a framework of event-based distributed estimation is developed,
where each sensor node runs a local filter using solely its own measurement,
alongside with an event-based synchronization algorithm to fuse the neighboring
information. One novelty of the proposed framework is that it decouples the
local filter from synchronization process. By doing so, we prove that a general
class of triggering strategies can be applied in our framework, which yields
stable distributed estimators under the minimal requirements of network
connectivity and collective system observability. As compared with existing
works, the proposed algorithm enjoys lower data size for each transmission.
Moreover, the developed results can be generalized to achieve a distributed
implementation of any Luenberger observer. By solving a semi-definite
programming (SDP), we further present a low-rank estimator design to obtain the
optimal gain of Luenberger observer such that the distributed estimation is
realized under the constraint of message complexity. Numerical examples are
finally provided to demonstrate the proposed methods."

intelligent transportation infrastructure, CAVs and connected human-driven
vehicles (CHVs) will coexist on the roads in the future for a long time. This
paper comprehensively considers the different traffic characteristics of CHVs
and CAVs, and systemically investigates the unsignalized intersection
management strategy from upper decision-making level to lower execution level.
Combined with the designed vehicle planning and control algorithm, the
unsignalized intersection management strategy consists of two parts: the
heuristic priority queues based right of way allocation (HPQ) algorithm, and
the vehicle planning and control algorithm. In the HPQ algorithm, a vehicle
priority management model considering the difference between CAVs and CHVs is
built to design the right of way management for CAVs and CHVs, respectively. In
the lower level for vehicle planning and control algorithm, different control
modes of CAVs are designed according to the upper level decision made by the
HPQ algorithm. Moreover, the vehicle control execution is realized by the model
predictive controller combined with the geographical environment constraints
and the unsignalized intersection management strategy. The proposed strategy is
evaluated by simulations, which show that the proposed intersection management
strategy can effectively reduce travel time and improve traffic efficiency. The
intersection management strategy captures the real-world balance between
efficiency and safety for potential future intelligent traffic systems."

high cost and low efficiency of energy supply. Moreover, in the case of
uncertain supply/demand, how to mobilize delay-tolerant elastic loads and
compensate real-time inelastic loads to match multi-energy generation/storage
and minimize energy cost is a key issue. Since energy management is hardly to
be implemented offline without knowing statistical information of random
variables, this paper presents a systematic online energy cost minimization
framework to fulfill the complementary utilization of multi-energy with
time-varying generation, demand and price. Specifically to achieve
charging/discharging constraints due to storage and short-term energy
balancing, a fast distributed algorithm based on stochastic gradient with
two-timescale implementation is proposed to ensure online implementation. To
reduce the peak loads, an incentive mechanism is implemented by estimating
users' willingness to shift. Analytical results on parameter setting are also
given to guarantee feasibility and optimality of the proposed design. Numerical
results show that when the bid-ask spread of electricity is small enough, the
proposed algorithm can achieve the close-to-optimal cost asymptotically."

a soft constraint becomes an equality constraint, and conventional smoothing
methods are not able to fully respect it. By contrast, once an appropriate Lie

gracefully accommodates this limit case in that the estimates tend to be

designing the stabilizing and safety controllers in closed-form. Since
analytical solutions to time-delay optimal control problems are hard to be
achieved, a sliding mode control based approach is developed to merge the

sliding surface functional, a feedback control law is established to
investigate the stabilization and safety objectives simultaneously. In

time-delay systems. Following both Razumikhin and Krasovskii approaches, we
propose novel control Lyapunov functions/functionals for the stabilization
problem and novel control barrier functions/functionals for the safety problem.
The proposed control Lyapunov and barrier functions/functionals extend the
existing ones from the delay-free case to the time-delay case, and allow for
designing the stabilizing and safety controllers in closed-form. Since
analytical solutions to time-delay optimal control problems are hard to be
achieved, a sliding mode control based approach is developed to merge the
proposed control Lyapunov and barrier functions/functionals. Based on the
sliding surface functional, a feedback control law is established to
investigate the stabilization and safety objectives simultaneously. In
particular, the properties of the sliding surface functional are analyzed, and
further how to construct the sliding surface functional is discussed. Finally,
the proposed approaches are illustrated via two numerical examples from the
connected cruise control problem of automotive systems and the synchronization
problem of multi-agent systems."

setpoints may be considered as private information of their respective owners.
Therefore, efforts must be put forth to avoid the disclosure through
adversarial analysis of load setpoints. In his paper, we consider a scenario
where LR takes place in a MG by determining load and ESS power injections
through the solution of an AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem. Since the

vehicle market diffusion. To this end, quickly and reliably finding suitable
charging stations may foster an electric vehicle uptake by mitigating drivers'
anxieties. Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available
stations based on real-time availability data but struggle with data
inaccuracy, e.g., due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public
charging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search
methods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver's
detour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and
theoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests
centralization or sharing of data, e.g., sharing observations of charging
stations' availability or visit intentions between drivers. Against this
background, we study coordinated stochastic search algorithms, which help to
reduce station visit conflicts and improve the drivers' charging experience. We
model a multi-agent stochastic charging station search problem as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce an online solution
framework applicable to static and dynamic policies. In contrast to static
policies, dynamic policies account for information updates during policy
planning and execution. We present a hierarchical implementation of a
single-agent heuristic for decentralized decision making and a rollout
algorithm for centralized decision making. Extensive numerical studies show
that compared to an uncoordinated setting, a decentralized setting with
visit-intentions sharing decreases the system cost by 26%, which is nearly as
good as the 28% cost decrease achieved in a centralized setting, and saves up
to 23% of a driver's search time while increasing her search reliability."

MRNs under formation control, where an inference robot with limited observation
range can manoeuvre among the formation robots. This problem faces new
challenges brought by the highly coupled influence of unobservable formation
robots, inaccessible formation inputs, and unknown interaction range. The novel
idea here is to advocate a range-shrink strategy to perfectly avoid the
influence of unobservable robots while filtering the input. To that end, we
develop consecutive algorithms to determine a feasible constant robot subset
from the changing robot set within the observation range, and estimate the
formation input and the interaction range. Then, an ordinary least squares
based local topology estimator is designed with the previously inferred
information. Resorting to the concentration measure, we prove the convergence
rate and accuracy of the proposed estimator, taking the estimation errors of
previous steps into account. Extensions on nonidentical observation slots and
more complicated scenarios are also analyzed. Comprehensive simulation tests

efficiently disrupt enemies' defense capability, protect our critical units,
and enhance the resistance to the destruction of system-of-system~(SOS).
However, the modeling of the combat network damage is not practical enough. In
this paper, we report a more realistic model to study the combat network damage
maximization problems. By analyzing realistic situations, the cost of damage is
redefined based on the network topology and the functional characteristics of
nodes. The damage effect is also updated according to the combat network
topology and operational capability. Hence, a cost-limited damage maximization
model for the combat network is constructed. In addition, to obtain optimal
solutions, an improved genetic algorithm~(IPGA) based on prior information is
proposed. As a result, our method has a significant advantage in the
feasibility and effectiveness compared with other algorithms in experiments.
The attack pattern of the combat network and the convergence and complexity of
the proposed algorithm are further explored. The improved model and algorithm,
as well as the mined attack patterns, can provide support for military
decisions."

'InfraRisk' and developed in Python, can simulate disaster-induced
infrastructure failures and subsequent post-disaster restoration in
interconnected water-, power-, and road networks. InfraRisk consists of an
infrastructure module, a hazard module, a recovery module, a simulation module,
and a resilience quantification module. The infrastructure module integrates
existing infrastructure network packages (wntr for water networks, pandapower
for power systems, and a static traffic assignment model for transportation
networks) through an interface that facilitates the network-level simulation of
interdependent failures. The hazard module generates infrastructure component
failure sequences based on various disaster characteristics. The recovery
module determines repair sequences and assigns repair crews based on predefined
heuristics-based recovery strategies or model predictive control (MPC) based
optimization. Based on the schedule, the simulation module implements the
network-wide simulation of the consequences of the disaster impacts and the
recovery actions. The resilience quantification module offers system-level and
consumer-level metrics to quantify both the risks and resilience of the
integrated infrastructure networks against disaster events. InfraRisk provides
a virtual platform for decision-makers to experiment and develop
region-specific pre-disaster and post-disaster policies to enhance the overall

comparison, well-known for its accommodation of constraints and stability

introduces an approach combining the two methodologies to overcome their
individual limitations. The predictive control law for constrained linear
quadratic regulation (CLQR) problems has been proven to be piecewise affine
(PWA) while the value function is piecewise quadratic. We exploit these formal
results from MPC to design an ADP method for CLQR problems. A novel convex and
piecewise quadratic neural network with a local-global architecture is proposed
to provide an accurate approximation of the value function, which is used as
the cost-to-go function in the online dynamic programming problem. An efficient
decomposition algorithm is developed to speed up the online computation.
Rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system is conducted for the
proposed control scheme under the condition that a good approximation of the
value function is achieved. Comparative simulations are carried out to
demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in terms of online computation

equipment damage. Electric utilities, to combat this, study inertia adequacy in
systems that are particularly vulnerable. This process, involving detailed
transient simulations, usually leads to a notion of a system-wide inertia

investigate the potential of cooperative localisation using time-ofarrival

this end, we study the performance of any unbiased estimator for localisation,
by calculating the instantaneous Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao bound for two
situations; one in which inter-satellite measurements and measurements from
ground stations were considered, and one in which only relative navigation from
inter-satellite measurements were considered. Our results show that
localisation determined from a combination of inter-satellite measurements and
ground stations can have at best an an average RMSE of approximately 10.15
metres over the majority of a satellite's orbit. Relative localisation using
only inter-satellite measurements has a slightly poorer performance with an
average RMSE of 10.68 metres. The results show that both anchored and
anchorless inter-satellite cooperative localisation are dependent on the
constellation's geometry and the characteristics of the inter-satellite links,

include lower maintenance requirements and independence from costly, dangerous

communities. Yet the adoption of electric vehicles in Australia has been slow
by international standards, and what policy strategies do exist tend to focus
on incentivizing uptake among urban residents with the means to afford new
technologies, potentially leaving remote communities in the 'too hard basket'.
In this study we assess the feasibility of EVs for a sample of communities in
remote Australia using Geographic Information System analysis of travel
distances between communities and service hub towns utilizing present-day EV
specifications and charging technologies. We show that while EV travel is often
not currently feasible for trips to large service hub towns using low-range
vehicles, over 99% of communities and residents considered would be able to
travel to their nearest small service hub town with existing long-range EVs.
This finding suggests that while the barriers to the electrification of

is one way to guarantee correctness. Though these methods have shown their

paper deals with two such modeling errors in differential dynamic logic.
Differential dynamic logic is a formal specification and verification language

The main contribution is to prove conditions that when fulfilled, these two
modeling errors cannot cause a faulty controller to be proven safe. The
problems are illustrated with a real world example of a safety controller for
automated driving, and it is shown that the formulated conditions have the
intended effect both for a faulty and a correct controller. It is also shown
how the formulated conditions aid in finding a loop invariant candidate to
prove properties of hybrid systems with feedback loops. The results are proven

overcome by enhancing today's information exchange and control. This can be
done by revealing and utilising inherent structure-preserving features of
complex physical systems, and, based on this, by establishing multi-layered
energy modeling. Each module (component, control area, non-utility-owned
entities) can be characterized in terms of its interaction variable, and higher
level models can be used to understand the interaction dynamics between
different modules. Once the structure is understood, we propose nonlinear
energy control for these modules which supports feed-forward self-adaptation to
ensure feasible interconnected system. Based on these technology agnostic

objectives the grasping task is established. Afterwards, for the first time in
the field of dual one-link flexible manipulators, intelligent control methods
are combined with robust control approaches in an effort to; i) accomplish
motion control objectives, ii) handle uncertainties in the system, and iii)
consider unknown, mixed input constraints, resulting in NABFC (Neuro-Adaptive

well as unknown input saturation and dead zones, Radial Basic Function

utilized to estimate unknown parameters. By exploiting Lyapunov's direct

express well-known yet strong stability procedure, which compensates a complex
stability procedure proposed in the previous works. In the presence of the
designed controller, the presented stability procedure resulted in a uniform

incorporated in a dynamic programming procedure to minimize the vehicle's total
fuel consumption. Constraints are introduced to ensure that vehicles do not,
collide with other vehicles, run red lights, or exceed a maximum vehicular jerk

comparable trajectories of uninformed drivers to compute fuel consumption

the uninformed driver amounting to 37 percent on average for deterministic SPAT

understand how the degree of uncertainty in SPaT predictions affects the
optimal trajectory's fuel consumption. The results present the required levels

sector coupling and end-user prosumer coordination. These options can be
collectively harnessed to alleviate the wide-scale LV grid reinforcement needs.
However, the size of the planning and optimization problem can now grow to
intractable levels even for commercial solvers. Additionally, the presumption
of complete coordination within the distribution system is far from the current
reality. In this work, we apply a multi-level approach, separating the planning
and operation stages of the systems with different temporal scales. This
reduces the computational burden and also simulates the realistic level of
system coordination for an LV distribution grid. Case studies conducted for a
representative rural grid in Germany clearly show a high economic potential in
the flexible operation of buildings with increased integration of photovoltaics
and reduced capacity sizing of heat pumps. The scenario with an idealized level

measures in ways that are impossible with conventional automobiles. These
functions are executed through vehicle control systems, which have been the
subject of considerable research. Autonomous cars have a distinct advantage as
they possess various perception sensors that can predict road surface
conditions and other phenomena ahead of time. Many modern automotive control
systems treat the road slope as a constant and do not account for changes in
the road profile in their vehicle models. As a result, vehicle states may be
miscalculated, which, in the worst-case scenario, may result in accidents. This
is particularly true for high center-of-gravity vehicles like trailers and
delivery trucks. With the help of perception sensors in autonomous vehicles, a
road slope estimation system can be developed to aid these control systems in
making informed decisions regarding the vehicle's state. The current review is
divided into three logical steps that can be discussed in the following manner:
the first section describes and reviews the individual steps for developing a
road slope estimation system. The second one provides a detailed review of
previous investigations that implemented different methods that employ this
prediction system to improve overall vehicle performance. Finally, a roll

questionable, while network-wide application is limited due to high
instrumentation cost. Perimeter control (PC) based on the concept of the

that regulates exchange flows between regions, in order to maintain maximum
regional travel production and prevent over-saturation. Yet, homogeneity
assumption is hardly realistic in congested states, thus compromising PC
efficiency. In this paper, the effectiveness of network-wide, parallel
application of PC and MP embedded in a two-layer control framework is assessed
with mesoscopic simulation. Aiming at reducing implementation cost of MP

test different configurations of the proposed framework, for a real large-scale

combined control of MP and PC outperforms separate MP and PC applications in

estimated uncertainty, the method aims to continuously monitor the
car-following (CF) performance of the AV to support strategic actions to
maintain a desired performance. Our methodology consists of three sequential
components: (i) the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is adopted to
estimate parameter uncertainty relative to vehicular dynamics in real time,
(ii) dynamic monitoring of car-following stability (local and string-wise), and
(iii) strategic actions for control adjustment if anomaly is detected. The
proposed methodology provides means to gauge AV car-following performance in
real time and preserve desired performance against real time uncertainty that
are unaccounted for in the vehicle control algorithm."

achieved by integrating an internal wind turbine (IWT) model in the Weather

human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a foreseeable future. Therefore, considering
the mixed traffic environment is more pragmatic, as the well-planned operation
of CAVs may be interrupted by HDVs. In the circumstance that human behaviors
have significant impacts, CAVs need to understand HDV behaviors to make safe
actions. In this study, we develop a Driver Digital Twin (DDT) for the online
prediction of personalized lane change behavior, allowing CAVs to predict
surrounding vehicles' behaviors with the help of the digital twin technology.
DDT is deployed on a vehicle-edge-cloud architecture, where the cloud server
models the driver behavior for each HDV based on the historical naturalistic
driving data, while the edge server processes the real-time data from each
driver with his/her digital twin on the cloud to predict the lane change
maneuver. The proposed system is first evaluated on a human-in-the-loop
co-simulation platform, and then in a field implementation with three passenger
vehicles connected through the 4G/LTE cellular network. The lane change
intention can be recognized in 6 seconds on average before the vehicle crosses
the lane separation line, and the Mean Euclidean Distance between the predicted
trajectory and GPS ground truth is 1.03 meters within a 4-second prediction
window. Compared to the general model, using a personalized model can improve

natural degradation is deterministic and can be nonlinear. The damage increment
caused by a random shock follows a certain distribution, and its parameters are
related to the degradation state. Maintenance methods include corrective
maintenance and imperfect maintenance. Imperfect maintenance reduces the
degradation degree of the system according to a random proportion. The
maintenance action is delayed, and the system will suffer natural degradations
and random shocks while waiting for maintenance. At each inspection time, the
decision-maker needs to make a choice among planning no maintenance, imperfect
maintenance and perfect maintenance, so as to minimize the total discounted
cost of the system. The impulse optimal control theory of PDMP is used to
determine the optimal maintenance strategy. A numerical study dealing with

events are likely to increase, posing a threat to infrastructure systems'

depends on whether assets are affected randomly, in a targeted strategic way,

including new routes or improvements to existing assets, will underpin the
behaviour of the systems over the next century. It is important to separate and
analyse the case of climate-based disruptions and how they affect systems'
resilience. This paper presents a probabilistic resilience assessment framework
where failure scenarios and network disruptions are generated using weather
profile data from climate prediction models with component-level fragility

Britain's railway passenger transport system to high-temperature-related track

uncontrolled behavior of selfish users. This may result in societal costs that
are significantly higher compared to what could be achieved by a centralized
system-optimal controller. Monetary tolling schemes can effectively align the
behavior of selfish users with the system-optimum. Yet, they inevitably
discriminate the population in terms of income. Artificial currencies were
recently presented as an effective alternative that can achieve the same
performance, whilst guaranteeing fairness among the population. However, those
studies were based on behavioral models that may differ from practical
implementations. This paper presents a data-driven approach to automatically
adapt artificial-currency tolls within repetitive-game settings. We first
consider a parallel-arc setting whereby users commute on a daily basis from a
unique origin to a unique destination, choosing a route in exchange of an
artificial-currency price or reward while accounting for the impact of the
choices of the other users on travel discomfort. Second, we devise a
model-based reinforcement learning controller that autonomously learns the
optimal pricing policy by interacting with the proposed framework considering
the closeness of the observed aggregate flows to a desired system-optimal
distribution as a reward function. Our numerical results show that the proposed
data-driven pricing scheme can effectively align the users' flows with the
system optimum, significantly reducing the societal costs with respect to the
uncontrolled flows (by about 15% and 25% depending on the scenario), and
respond to environmental changes in a robust and efficient manner."

developments as AVs enable a centrally operated and fully connected fleet.
There are two fundamental tasks for a shared MoD service: ride-matching and
vehicle rebalancing. Traditionally, these two functions are performed
sequentially and independently. In this paper, we propose and formulate an
integrated ride-matching problem which aims to integrate ride-matching and

the integrated shared ride-matching problem by using supply level information

tackle these issues, we develop guided tree search, a novel methodology
combining model-free RL and model-based planning. The UC problem is formalised
as a Markov decision process and we develop an open-source environment based on
real data from Great Britain's power system to train RL agents. In problems of
up to 100 generators, guided tree search is shown to be competitive with
deterministic UC methods, reducing operating costs by up to 1.4\%. An advantage
of RL is that the framework can be easily extended to incorporate
considerations important to power systems operators such as robustness to
generator failure, wind curtailment or carbon prices. When generator outages
are considered, guided tree search saves over 2\% in operating costs as
compared with methods using conventional $N-x$ reserve criteria."

for optimising energy efficient operation. Distributed control of fluid systems
combines reliable local control of components while using system-wide
cooperation to ensure energy efficient operation. The presented work compares
three approaches to distributed control based on multi-agent systems,
distributed model predictive control (DMPC), multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MADRL) and market mechanism design. These approaches were applied to
a generic fluid system and evaluated with regard to functionality, energy
efficient operation, modeling effort, reliability in the face of disruptions,
and transparency of control decisions. All approaches were shown to fulfil the
functionality, though a trade-off between functional quality and energy
efficiency was identified. Increased modeling effort was shown to improve the
performance slightly while a strong interdependence of information caused by
excessive information sharing has proven to be disadvantageous. DMPC and
partially observable MADRL were less sensitive to disruptions than market
mechanism. In conclusion, agent-based control of fluid systems achieves greater
energy efficiency than conventional methods, with values similar to centralized
optimal control and thus represent a viable design approach of fluid system
control."

Pickering'), arxiv.Result.Author('Keith J. Burnham')]","Developments in autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly advancing and will in
the next 20 years become a central part to our society. However, especially in
the early stages of deployment, there is expected to be incidents involving
AVs. In the event of AV incidents, decisions will need to be made that require
ethical decisions, e.g., deciding between colliding into a group of pedestrians
or a rigid barrier. For an AV to undertake such ethical decision making and
path planning, simulation models of the situation will be required that are
used in real-time on-board the AV. These models will enable path planning and
ethical decision making to be undertaken based on predetermined collision
injury severity levels. In this research, models are developed for the path
planning and ethical decision making that predetermine knowledge regarding the
possible collision injury severities, i.e., peak deformation of the AV
colliding into the rigid barrier or the impact velocity of the AV colliding
into a pedestrian. Based on such knowledge and using fuzzy logic, a novel
nonlinear weighted utility cost function for the collision injury severity
levels is developed. This allows the model-based predicted collision outcomes
arising from AV peak deformation and AV-pedestrian impact velocity to be
examined separately via weighted utility cost functions with a common
structure. The general form of the weighted utility cost function exploits a
fuzzy sets approach, thus allowing common utility costs from the two separate
utility cost functions to be meaningfully compared. A decision-making
algorithm, which makes use of a utilitarian ethical approach, ensures that the
AV will always steer onto the path which represents the lowest injury severity
level, hence utility cost to society."
