description of the asymptotics of Arakelov Green functions on Riemann surfaces

establish the convergence of the Laplace operator on metric graphs toward the
tropical Laplace operator on limit tropical curves in the corresponding moduli
spaces, leading to new perspectives in operator theory on metric graphs.
  Our result on the Arakelov Green function is inspired by the works of several
authors, in particular those of Faltings, de Jong, Wentworth and Wolpert, and

the use of differential-geometric methods arising from K\""ahler metrics on
$\mathcal H \times \mathbb C$ invariant under the action of the semi-direct
product ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb R) \ltimes \mathbb R^2$. To a properly chosen
geometric model $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ of ${\bf E}$ as an elliptic surface and
a non-torsion holomorphic section $\sigma: B \to \mathcal E$ there is an
associated ``verticality'' $\eta_\sigma$ of $\sigma$ related to the locally
defined Betti map. The first-order linear differential equation satisfied by
$\eta_\sigma$, expressed in terms of invariant metrics, is made use of to count
the zeros of $\eta_\sigma$, in the case when the regular locus $B^0\subset B$
of $\pi: \mathcal E \to B$ admits a classifying map $f_0$ into a modular curve
for elliptic curves with level-$k$ structure, $k \ge 3$, explicitly and
linearly in terms of the degree of the ramification divisor $R_{f_0}$ of the
classifying map, and the degree of the log-canonical line bundle of $B^0$ in
$B$. Our method highlights ${\rm deg}(R_{f_0})$ in the estimates, and recovers
the effective estimate obtained by a different method of Ulmer-Urz\'ua on the
multiplicities of the Betti map associated to a non-torsion section, noting
that the finiteness of zeros of $\eta_\sigma$ was due to
Corvaja-Demeio-Masser-Zannier. The role of $R_{f_0}$ is natural in the subject

non-torsion sections of certain abelian schemes."

express obstructions to rationality of bitangents and their points of tangency

on the tropicalization and the initial coefficients of the defining equation

  We also show that the GW-multiplicity of a tropical bitangent, i.e., the
multiplicity with which its lifts contribute to the $\mathbb{A}^1$-enumeration
of bitangents as defined by Larson and Vogt, can be computed from the
tropicalization of the quartic together with the initial coefficients of the
defining equation. As an application, we show that the four lifts of most

the continuous CM-regularity of torsion-free coherent sheaves on
$(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, and its relation with the theory of generic vanishing.
This continuous variant of CM-regularity was introduced by Mustopa, and he
raised the question whether a continuously $1$-regular such sheaf $\mathcal{F}$
is GV. Here we answer the question in the affirmative for many pairs
$(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ which includes the case of any polarized abelian

continuously $k$-regular for some integer $1\leq k\leq \dim X$, then
$\mathcal{F}$ is a GV$_{-(k-1)}$ sheaf. Further, we extend the notion of
continuous CM-regularity to a real valued function on the $\mathbb{Q}$-twisted
bundles on polarized abelian varieties $(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, and we show that
this function can be extended to a continuous function on

reductive group. First, we exhibit an example of a klt singularity admitting a
$\mathbb{P}{\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{K})$-cover that is not of klt type. Then, we
restrict ourselves to $G$-quasi-torsors, a special class of $G$-covers that
behave like $G$-torsors outside closed subsets of codimension two. Given a
$G$-quasi-torsor $X\rightarrow Y$, where $G$ is a finite extension of a torus
$\mathbb{T}$, we show that $X$ is of klt type if and only if $Y$ is of klt
type. We prove a structural theorem for $\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over normal
varieties in terms of Cox rings. As an application, we show that every sequence
of $\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over a variety with klt type singularities is
eventually a sequence of $\mathbb{T}$-torsors. This is the torus version of a
result due to Greb-Kebekus-Peternell regarding finite quasi-torsors of
varieties with klt type singularities. On the contrary, we show that in any
dimension there exists a sequence of finite quasi-torsors and
$\mathbb{T}$-quasi-torsors over a klt type variety, such that infinitely many
of them are not torsors. We show that every variety with klt type singularities
is a quotient of a variety with canonical factorial singularities. We prove
that a variety with Zariski locally toric singularities is indeed the quotient
of a smooth variety by a solvable group. Finally, motivated by the work of
Stibitz, we study the optimal class of singularities for which the previous
results hold."

a subalgebra $\mathcal H(C,\sigma)$ of $A_C$ to any such section $\sigma$. When
$C$ has genus $0$, we exhibit a particular section $\sigma_0$ and show
$\mathcal H(C,\sigma_0)$ to coincide with the algebra of hyperlogarithm
functions (Poincar\'e, Lappo-Danilevsky)."

study the K-moduli of log pairs of the form (Pn, cD), with a detailed analysis of plane curves.","Furthermore,

a Fano complete intersection of hypersurfaces of fixed degree and a hyperplane,
by constructing an isomorphism with certain GIT quotients. We characterize all
possible GIT quotients of complete intersections of these hypersurfaces and
hyperplanes. Our main result is the first example of wall crossing for the
K-moduli of log pairs, where both variety and divisor admit deformations before
and after the wall. Furthermore, we explicitly describe the K-moduli of the
deformation family of Fano 3-folds 2.25 in the Mori-Mukai classification, which
can be viewed as blow ups of complete intersections of two quadrics in
dimension three.
  Our work uses the moduli continuity method for log pairs by relating the
K-moduli to certain GIT compactifications. In addition, we introduce the
reverse moduli continuity method, which allows us to relate GIT
compactifications to K-moduli of Fano varieties. We use explicit GIT methods to
classify in detail the GIT stability of a complete intersection of two quadrics
in dimension four together with a hyperplane section. We also classify the GIT
stability of a complete intersection of two quadrics in dimension three.
Furthermore, we explicitly compactify the moduli space of log Fano pairs of
complete intersections and hyperplane sections, by establishing a direct link
with GIT.
  We use the above methods to prove our main result, namely the explicit
description of the first wall crossing for the K-moduli of log Fano pairs, of
complete intersections of two quadrics in dimension four, and a hyperplane
section. The reverse moduli continuity method, alongside our computational GIT
techniques, allow us to compactify the K-moduli of the deformation family of
Fano 3-folds 2.25, which is one of the only three known explicit
compactifications of K-moduli of Fano threefolds."
