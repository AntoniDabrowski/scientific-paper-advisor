Bernard'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Crampe'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. Vinet')]","The time and band limiting operator is introduced to optimize the
reconstruction of a signal from only a partial part of its spectrum. In the
discrete case, this operator commutes with the so-called algebraic Heun
operator which appears in the context of the quantum integrable systems. The
construction of both operators and the proof of their commutativity is
recalled. A direct connection between their spectra is obtained. Then, the
Bethe ansatz, a well-known method to diagonalize integrable quantum
Hamiltonians, is used to diagonalize the Heun operator and to obtain insights
on the spectrum of the time and band limiting operator."

system in this way, due to the complications of manipulating a system made of
few particles while maintaining the quantum correlations. As a consequence the
systems need to be kept at very low temperatures and the interactions have to
be performed very fast. The Quantum Control at the Boundary approach is
radically different to the standard one. Instead of seeking the control of the
quantum system by directly interacting with it through an external field, the
control is achieved by manipulating the boundary conditions of the system. The
spectrum of a quantum system, for instance an electron moving in a box, depends
on the boundary conditions imposed on it. Hence, a modification of such
boundary conditions modifies the state of the system allowing for its
manipulation and, eventually, its control. This kind of interaction is weaker,
which makes one to expect that it may help maintaining the quantum
correlations. For showing the viability of the Quantum Control at the Boundary

generalization of quantum grahs) is introduced. Before being able to address
the problem of controllability, the problem of existence of solutions for the

controllability result by T. Chambrion et al. (2009) and a stability result

1 Introduction

The Skinner–Rusk formalism was introduced by R. Skinner and R. Rusk in 1983 [44] (although
a previous description in local coordinates had been developed by K. Kamimura in [34]) in order
to deal with mechanical systems described by singular Lagrangian functions.",.,"This formulation
combines both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism and this is why it is sometimes called
uniﬁed formalism.",2022-05-29 20:09:07+00:00,Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism for time-dependent dissipative mechanical systems,math-ph,"['math-ph', 'math.MP', 'math.SG', '37J55, 70H03, 70H05, 53D10, 70G45, 53Z05, 70H45']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Xavier Rivas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Torres')]","In this paper we present a unified Lagrangian--Hamiltonian geometric
formalism to describe time-dependent contact mechanical systems, based on the
one first introduced by K. Kamimura and later formalized by R. Skinner and R.
Rusk. This formalism is especially interesting when dealing with systems
described by singular Lagrangians, since the second-order condition is
recovered from the constraint algorithm. In order to illustrate this
formulation, some relevant examples are described in full detail: the Duffing
equation, an ascending particle with time-dependent mass and quadratic drag,
and a charged particle in a stationary electric field with a time-dependent
constraint."

6 Conclusions and further research

We have generalized the Skinner–Rusk uniﬁed formalism for time-dependent contact systems.","The friction coeﬃcient is γ = 0.3 and the initial conﬁguration of the
system is q(0) = (2, 0, 0), v(0) = (0, 10, 0).","This framework allows to skip the second-order problem, since this condition is recovered in the
ﬁrst step of the constraint algorithm for both regular and singular Lagrangians.",2022-05-29 20:09:07+00:00,Lagrangian-Hamiltonian formalism for time-dependent dissipative mechanical systems,math-ph,"['math-ph', 'math.MP', 'math.SG', '37J55, 70H03, 70H05, 53D10, 70G45, 53Z05, 70H45']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Xavier Rivas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Torres')]","In this paper we present a unified Lagrangian--Hamiltonian geometric

motivated by a concrete experimental set-up, we deal with a situation when the
magnetic field is measured on a portion of the plane in vicinity of the sample
and only one (normal to the plane) component of the field is available. We
assume the measurement area to be a sufficiently large disk (lying in a
horizontal plane above the sample) and we obtain a set of estimates for the
components of the net moment vector with the accuracy asymptotically improving
with the increase of the radius of the measurement disk. Compared to our
previous preliminary results, the asymptotic estimates are now rigorously
justified and higher-order estimates are given. The presented approach also
elucidates the derivation of asymptotic estimates of an arbitrary order. The
obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect
to noise is discussed."

assume the measurement area to be a sufficiently large disk (lying in a

components of the net moment vector with the accuracy asymptotically improving
with the increase of the radius of the measurement disk. Compared to our
previous preliminary results, the asymptotic estimates are now rigorously
justified and higher-order estimates are given. The presented approach also

1 Introduction

During the second half of the 20th century, geometric methods have been widely applied to

mechanics and ﬁeld theory with the aim of providing geometric descriptions of a large variety of

systems in applied mathematics, physics, engineering, etc.",.,"Some of the most frequent geometric

structures involved in geometric mechanics and ﬁeld theory are symplectic, multisymplectic or

k-symplectic manifolds (see for instance [1, 2, 3, 9, 21, 22, 34, 35, 37, 42] and references therein).",2022-10-17 15:11:15+00:00,Nonautonomous k-contact field theories,math-ph,"['math-ph', 'math.DG', 'math.MP', '70S05, 53Z05, 53D10, 53C15']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Xavier Rivas')],"This paper provides a new geometric framework to describe non-conservative
field theories with explicit dependence on the space-time coordinates by
combining the k-cosymplectic and k-contact formulations. This geometric
framework, the k-cocontact geometry, permits to develop a Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian formalisms for these field theories. We also compare this new
formulation in the autonomous case with the previous k-contact formalism. To
illustrate the theory, we study the nonlinear damped wave equation with
external time-dependent forcing."

In this paper we have introduced a new geometric framework to describe non-autonomous non-
conservative ﬁeld theories: k-cocontact structures.","As in the Lagrangian case, it is clear that ψ satisﬁes the equation

                       ∂t2 − ∂x2 + ∂u (t, u) + γ(x) ∂t = 0 ,

of the original algebra can be recovered from the composition of the flows of
the corresponding vector fields. For this reason we call our method the flow

known as the Calogero-Moser system. Its classical version can be generalised by
substituting the coupling constants with additional degrees of freedom, which
span the $\mathfrak{so}(N)$ or $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ algebra with respect to
Poisson brackets. We present the quantum version of this generalized model. As
the classical generalization is obtained by a symplectic reduction of a free
system, we present a method of obtaining a quantum system along similar lines.
The reduction of a free quantum system results in a Hamiltonian, which
preserves the differences in dynamics of the classical system depending on the
underlying, orthogonal or unitary, symmetry group. The orthogonal system is
known to be less repulsive than the unitary one, and the reduced free quantum
Hamiltonian manifests this trait through an additional attractive term
$\sum_{i<j}\frac{-\hbar^2}{(x_i-x_j)^2}$, which is absent when one performs the
straightforward Dirac quantization of the considered system. We present a
detailed and rigorous derivation of the generalized quantum Calogero-Moser
Hamiltonian, we find the spectra and wavefunctions for the number of particles
$N=2,3$, and we diagonalize the Hamiltonian partially for a general value of
$N$."

symmetric matrices having additional structural constraint to reduce the number
of independent entries to only $ (n+1)/2 $ in contrast to the $ n(n+1)/2 $ for
a real symmetric matrix of size $ n \times n $. We derive all the results
analytically exactly for the $ 3\times 3 $ matrices and show that spacing
distribution display a range of behaviour based on the structural constraint.
The spacing distribution of the ensemble of reverse circulant matrices with
additional zeros is found to fall slower than exponential for larger spacing
while that of symmetric circulant matrices has poisson spacings. The
palindromic symmetric toeplitz matrices on the other hand show level repulsion
but the distribution is significantly different from Wigner. The behaviour of
spacings for all the three ensembles clearly show the departure from universal
result of Wigner distribution for real symmetric matrices. The deviation from
universality continues in large $ n $ cases as well, which we study
numerically."
