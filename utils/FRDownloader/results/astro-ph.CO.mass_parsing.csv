hot plasma is virialised inside clusters (< R200), the dynamics of warm hot
inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two regimes: accumulating and
slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries (~ R200) and fast infalling motions
outside clusters (> 1.5 R200). The azimuthal distribution of dark matter (DM),
hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by decomposing their
2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the azimuthal symmetries
of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural properties, such as their
center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical shapes. Beyond cluster
virialised regions, we found that WHIM gas follows the azimuthal distribution

parts of the information on the universe. Some researchers believe that The
gravitational system cannot be decribed by the standard statistical mechanics.
In this article we apply Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics to
investigate CMB spectrum and related cosmological processes. Based on recent
observational data we find that the nonextensive statistical mechanics can
modify the values of related physical quantites. Since the value of physical
quantites have changed, some processes, such as recombination, can be affected.
We have investigated the anisotropy of the CMB for two effects: the dipole
anisotropy of CMB and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find that the dipole
anisotropy of CMB cannot be modified by the nonextensive statistical mechanics.
However, the standard result of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect should be
modified by nonextensive statistical mechanics. In principle, future work can
distinguish these effects."

consequences of a particular class of primordial non-Gaussianity that is fully
characterized by initial density fluctuations drawn from a non-Gaussian
probability density function, rather than by construction of a particular form
for the primordial bispectrum. We numerically generate multiple realisations of
cosmological structure and use the late-time matter power spectrum, bispectrum
and trispectrum to determine the effect of these modified initial conditions.
We show that the initial non-Gaussianity has only a small imprint on the first
three polyspectra, when compared to a standard Gaussian cosmology. Furthermore,
some of our models present an interesting scale-dependent deviation from the
Gaussian case in the bispectrum and trispectrum, although the signal is at most
at the percent level. The majority of our models are consistent with CMB
constraints on the trispectrum, while the others are only marginally excluded.

using multi-band light-curves and host galaxy redshifts. For this analysis, we
use the photometric classification framework SuperNNova (SNN; M\""oller et al.
2019) trained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable classification,
we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data and introduce improvements to the
classifier architecture, obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98
per cent on simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of
ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples. Using photometry, host
galaxy redshifts, and a classification probability requirement, we identify
1,863 SNe Ia from which we select 1,484 cosmology-grade SNe Ia spanning the
redshift range of 0.07 < z < 1.14. We find good agreement between the
light-curve properties of the photometrically-selected sample and simulations.
Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using two types of Bayesian
Neural Network classifiers that provide uncertainties on the classification
probabilities. We test the feasibility of using these uncertainties as
indicators for out-of-distribution candidates and model confidence. Finally, we
discuss the implications of photometric samples and classification methods for
future surveys such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and

Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present photometrically identified SN Ia samples
using multi-band light-curves and host galaxy redshifts. For this analysis, we
use the photometric classification framework SuperNNova (SNN; M\""oller et al.
2019) trained on realistic DES-like simulations. For reliable classification,
we process the DES SN programme (DES-SN) data and introduce improvements to the
classifier architecture, obtaining classification accuracies of more than 98
per cent on simulations. This is the first SN classification to make use of
ensemble methods, resulting in more robust samples. Using photometry, host
galaxy redshifts, and a classification probability requirement, we identify
1,863 SNe Ia from which we select 1,484 cosmology-grade SNe Ia spanning the
redshift range of 0.07 < z < 1.14. We find good agreement between the
light-curve properties of the photometrically-selected sample and simulations.
Additionally, we create similar SN Ia samples using two types of Bayesian
Neural Network classifiers that provide uncertainties on the classification
probabilities. We test the feasibility of using these uncertainties as
indicators for out-of-distribution candidates and model confidence. Finally, we
discuss the implications of photometric samples and classification methods for
future surveys such as Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST)."

Using Buzzard simulations, we quantify one such systematic, the triaxiality
distribution of clusters identified with the redMaPPer optical cluster finding
algorithm, which was used in the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 (DES Y1) cluster
cosmology analysis. We test whether redMaPPer selection biases the clusters'
shape and orientation and find that it only biases orientation, preferentially
selecting clusters with their major axes oriented along the line of sight.
Modeling the richness-mass relation as a log-linear relation, we find that the
log-richness amplitude $\ln(A)$ is boosted from the lowest to highest
orientation bin with a significance of $14\sigma$, while the orientation
dependence of the richness-mass slope and intrinsic scatter is minimal. We also
find that the weak lensing shear-profile ratios of cluster-associated dark
halos in different orientation bins resemble a ""bottleneck"" shape that can be
quantified with a Cauchy function. We test the correlation of orientation with
two other leading systematics in cluster cosmology -- miscentering and
projection -- and find a null correlation. Analytic templates for the
triaxiality bias of observed-richness and lensing profiles are mapped as
corrections to the observable of richness-binned lensing profiles for redMaPPer
clusters. The resulting mass bias confirms the DES Y1 finding that triaxiality
is a leading source of bias in cluster cosmology. However, the
richness-dependence of the bias confirms that triaxiality does not fully
resolve the tension at low-richness between DES Y1 cluster cosmology and other
probes. Our model can be used for quantifying the impact of triaxiality bias on
cosmological constraints for upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters."

discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus
on the tension of the {\it Planck} CMB data with weak lensing measurements and
redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density $\Omega_m$, and
the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure ($\sigma_8,f\sigma_8$). We
list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we
discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single

(LSST) in 2024, spanning an area of 18,000 square degrees in six bands, with
more than 800 observations of each field over ten years. The unprecedented data
set will enable great advances in the study of the formation and evolution of
structure and exploration of physics of the dark universe. The observations
will hold clues about the cause for the accelerated expansion of the universe
and possibly the nature of dark matter. During the next decade, LSST will be
able to confirm or dispute if tensions seen today in cosmological data are due
to new physics. New and unexpected phenomena could confirm or disrupt our
current understanding of the universe. Findings from LSST will guide the path
forward post-LSST. The Rubin Observatory will still be a uniquely powerful
facility even then, capable of revealing further insights into the physics of
the dark universe. These could be obtained via innovative observing strategies,
e.g., targeting new probes at shorter timescales than with LSST, or via modest
instrumental changes, e.g., new filters, or through an entirely new instrument
for the focal plane. This White Paper highlights some of the opportunities in
each scenario from Rubin observations after LSST."

agreement with the expectation from LambdaCDM. In comparison to previous
studies, this result extends the mass range over which the HMF has now been
measured over by an order of magnitude. We combine the GAMA DR4 HMF with
similar data from the SDSS DR12 and REFLEX II surveys, and fit a four-parameter
Murray-Robotham-Power (MRP) function, valid at z~0.1, yielding: a density
normalisation of: log10 (phi Mpc^3)=-3.96[+0.55,-0.82], a high mass turn-over
of: log10(M/M_sol)=14.13[+0.43,-0.40], a low mass power law slope of:
alpha=-1.68[+0.21,-0.24] , and a high mass softening parameter of: beta=
0.63[+0.25,-0.11]. If we fold in the constraint on Omega_M from Planck 2018
Cosmology, we are able to reduce these uncertainties further, but this relies
on the assumption that the power-law trend can be extrapolated from
10^12.7M_sol to zero mass. Throughout, we highlight the effort needed to
improve on our HMF measurement: improved halo mass estimates that do not rely
on calibration to simulations; reduced halo mass uncertainties needed to
mitigate the strong Eddington Bias that arises from the steepness of the HMF
low mass slope; and deeper wider area spectroscopic surveys. To our halo mass
limit of 10^12.7 M_sol, we are directly resolving (`seeing') 41+/-5 per cent of

efficient statistical measure which can probe clustering information beyond
that of the conventional 2-point statistics. In this work, we extend the
traditional mark weighted statistics by using powers of the density field
gradient $|\nabla \rho/\rho|^\alpha$ as the weight, and use the angular
dependence of the scale-averaged MCFs to constrain cosmological parameters. The
analysis shows that the gradient based weighting scheme is statistically more
powerful than the density based weighting scheme, while combining the two
schemes together is more powerful than separately using either of them.
Utilising the density weighted or the gradient weighted MCFs with $\alpha=0.5,\
1$, we can strengthen the constraint on $\Omega_m$ by factors of 2 or 4,
respectively, compared with the standard 2-point correlation function, while
simultaneously using the MCFs of the two weighting schemes together can be
$1.25$ times more statistically powerful than using the gradient weighting
scheme alone. The mark weighted statistics may play an important role in
cosmological analysis of future large-scale surveys. Many issues, including the
possibility of using other types of weights, the influence of the bias on this
statistics, as well as the usage of MCFs in the tomographic Alcock-Paczynski
method, are worth further investigations."

is smaller than the cosmic variance at $\ell>10$. We then apply this method to
the current Planck observation, and find that the recovered CMB is quite
consistent with that disclosed by the Planck collaboration, which indicates
that the CNN method can provide a promising approach to the component
separation of CMB observations. Furthermore, we test the CNN method with
simulated CMB polarization maps based on the CMB-S4 experiment. The result
shows that both the EE and BB power spectra can be recovered with high
accuracy. Therefore, this method will be helpful for the detection of
primordial gravitational waves in current and future CMB experiments. The CNN
is designed to analyze two-dimensional images, thus this method is not only
able to process full-sky maps, but also partial-sky maps. Therefore, it can
also be used for other similar experiments, such as radio surveys like the
Square Kilometer Array."

dark energy for its explanation if general relativity is an accurate model of
gravity. However, dark energy is a mysterious quantity and we do not know much
about its nature so understanding dark energy is an exciting scientific
challenge. Cosmological dark energy models are fairly well tested in the low
and high redshift parts of the universe. The highest of the low redshift,
$z\sim2.3$, region is probed by baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements
and the only high redshift probe is the cosmic microwave background anisotropy
which probes the $z\sim1100$ part of redshift space. In the intermediate
redshift range $2.3 < z < 1100$ there are only a handful of observational
probes and cosmological models are poorly tested in this region.
  In this thesis we constrain three pairs of general relativistic cosmological
dark energy models using observational data which reach beyond the current BAO
limit. We use quasar X-ray and UV flux measurements, the current version of
these data span $0.009 \leq z \leq 7.5413$. We have discovered that most of
these data cannot be standardized using the proposed method. However, the lower
redshift part, $z \lesssim 1.5-1.7$, of these data are standardizable and can
be used to derive lower-$z$ cosmological constraints. Another data set we use
are gamma-ray burst measurements which span $0.3399 \leq z \leq 8.2$.
Cosmological constraints derived from these data are significantly weaker than,
but consistent with, those obtained from better-established cosmological
probes. We also study and standardize 78 reverberation-measured Mg II time-lag
quasars in the redshift range $0.0033 \leq z \leq 1.89$ by using their
radius-luminosity relation. We also study 118 reverberation-measured H$\beta$

approach to simultaneously determine the Hubble constant and cosmic curvature
with strong lensing time-delay measurements, without any prior assumptions
regarding the content of the Universe. The data we use comprises the recent
compilation of six well studied strongly lensed quasars, while the cosmic
chronometer data are utilized to reconstruct distances via cosmographic
parameters. In the framework of third-order Taylor expansion and (2, 1) order
Pad\'{e} approximation for for cosmographic analysis, our results provides
model-independent estimation of the Hubble constant $H_0 =
72.24^{+2.73}_{-2.52} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 72.45^{+1.95}_{-2.02}
~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$, which is well consistent with that derived from the local
distance ladder by SH0ES collaboration. The measured cosmic curvature
$\Omega_k=0.062^{+0.117}_{-0.078}$ and $\Omega_k=0.069^{+0.116}_{-0.103}$ shows
that zero spatial curvature is supported by the current observations of strong
lensing time delays and cosmic chronometers. Imposing the prior of spatial
flatness leads to more precise (at 1.6$\%$ level) determination of the Hubble
constant $H_0=70.47^{+1.14}_{-1.15} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$ and
$H_0=71.66^{+1.15}_{-1.57} ~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$, a value located between the
results from \textit{Planck} and SH0ES collaboration. If a prior of local
(SH0ES) $H_0$ measurement is adopted, the curvature parameter constraint can be
further improved to $\Omega_k=0.123^{+0.060}_{-0.046}$ and
$\Omega_k=0.101^{+0.090}_{-0.072}$, supporting no significant deviation from a
flat universe. Finally, we also discuss the effectiveness of Pad\'{e}
approximation in reconstructing the cosmic expansion history within the
redshift range of $z\sim2.3$, considering its better performance in the Bayes
Information Criterion (BIC)."

implementation of energy input from AGN feedback models on the inner structure
of cluster sub-haloes in hydrodynamic simulations. We compare several zoom-in
re-simulations of a sub-sample of the cluster-sized haloes studied in
Meneghetti et al. (2020), obtained by varying mass resolution, softening length
and AGN energy feedback scheme. We study the impact of these different setups
on the subhalo abundances, their radial distribution, their density and mass
profiles and the relation between the maximum circular velocity, which is a
proxy for subhalo compactness. Regardless of the adopted numerical resolution
and feedback model, subhaloes with masses Msub < 1e11Msun/h, the most relevant
mass-range for galaxy-galaxy strong lensing, have maximum circular velocities
~30% smaller than those measured from strong lensing observations of Bergamini
et al. (2019). We also find that simulations with less effective AGN energy
feedback produce massive subhaloes (Msub> 1e11 Msun/h ) with higher maximum
circular velocity and that their Vmax - Msub relation approaches the observed
one. However the stellar-mass number count of these objects exceeds the one
found in observations and we find that the compactness of these simulated
subhaloes is the result of an extremely over-efficient star formation in their
cores, also leading to larger-than-observed subhalo stellar mass. We conclude
that simulations are unable to simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar
masses and compactness (or maximum circular velocities) of cluster galaxies.
Thus, the discrepancy between theory and observations that emerged from the
analysis of Meneghetti et al. (2020) persists. It remains an open question as
to whether such a discrepancy reflects limitations of the current
implementation of galaxy formation models or the LCDM paradigm."

variables. It hosts two sibling SNe Ia: SN 2021J and SN 1974G. This provides
the opportunity to improve the precision of the previous estimate of $H_{0}$,
which was based solely on SN 1974G. Here we present new optical $BVRI$
photometry obtained at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada and complement it with
Swift UVOT $UBV$ data, which cover the first 70 days of emission of SN 2021J. A
first look at SN 2021J optical spectra obtained with the Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC) reveals typical SN type Ia features. The main SN luminosity
parameters for the two sibling SNe are obtained by using SNooPy, a light curve
fitting code based on templates. Using a hierarchical bayesian approach, we
build the Hubble diagram with a sample of 96 SNe Ia obtained from the Combined
Pantheon Sample in the redshift range $z = 0.02-0.075$, and calibrate the zero
point with the two sibling type-Ia SNe in NGC 4414. We report a value of the
Hubble constant $H_{0}$ $= 72.19 \pm 2.32$ (stat.) $\pm 3.42$ (syst.) km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. We expect a reduction of the systematic error after a new
analysis of the Cepheids period-luminosity relation using the upcoming Gaia DR4
and additional Cepheids from the HST and JWST."

to extract cosmological information from thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and
kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect will be limited not by statistical
uncertainties but rather by systematic and theoretical uncertainties. The
theoretical uncertainty is driven by the lack of knowledge about the electron
pressure and density. Thus we explore the electron pressure and density
distributions in the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, and we
demonstrate that the cluster properties exhibit a strong dependence on the halo
concentration -- providing some of the first evidence of cluster assembly bias
in the electron pressure and density. Further, our work shows evidence for a
broken power-law mass dependence, with lower pressure in lower mass halos than
previous work and a strong evolution with mass of the radial correlations in
the electron density and pressure. Both of these effects highlight the
differing impact of active galactic nuclei and supernova feedback on the gas in
galaxy groups compared to massive clusters. We verified that we see
qualitatively similar features in the SIMBA hydro-dynamical simulations,
suggesting these effects could be generic features. Finally, we provide a
parametric formula for the electron pressure and density profile as a function
of dark matter halo mass, halo concentration, and redshift. These fitting
formulae can reproduce the distribution of density and pressure of clusters and
will be useful in extracting cosmological information from upcoming CMB
surveys."

contribution of dust, calibration of noise and signal, and the use of
photometric data in addition to spectral information; we as well identify
indicators of the correct convergence of the results, including the shape of
the posterior distributions, the analysis of specific spectral features, and
the correct reproduction of the observed spectrum. We derive a clear
age-redshift trend compatible with the aging in a standard cosmological model,
showing a clear downsizing pattern, with more massive galaxies being formed at
higher redshift ($z_f\sim2.5$) with respect to lower massive ones ($z_f\sim2$).

probes for dark matter and dark energy science, although it faces increasing
challenges in controlling systematic uncertainties as \edit{the statistical
errors become smaller}. The Point Spread Function (PSF) needs to be precisely
modeled to avoid systematic error on the weak lensing measurements. The weak
lensing biases induced by errors in the PSF model second moments, i.e., its
size and shape, are well-studied. However, Zhang et al. (2021) showed that
errors in the higher moments of the PSF may also be a significant source of
systematics for upcoming weak lensing surveys. Therefore, the goal of this work
is to comprehensively investigate the modeling quality of PSF moments from the
$3^{\text{rd}}$ to $6^{\text{th}}$ order, and estimate their impact on
cosmological parameter inference. We propagate the \textsc{PSFEx} higher
moments modeling error in the HSC survey dataset to the weak lensing
\edit{shear-shear correlation functions} and their cosmological analyses. We
find that the overall multiplicative shear bias associated with errors in PSF
higher moments can cause a $\sim 0.1 \sigma$ shift on the cosmological
parameters for LSST Y10. PSF higher moment errors also cause additive biases in
the weak lensing shear, which, if not accounted for in the cosmological
parameter analysis, can induce cosmological parameter biases comparable to
their $1\sigma$ uncertainties for LSST Y10. We compare the \textsc{PSFEx} model
with PSF in Full FOV (\textsc{Piff}), and find similar performance in modeling
the PSF higher moments. We conclude that PSF higher moment errors of the future
PSF models should be reduced from those in current methods to avoid a need to
explicitly model these effects in the weak lensing analysis."

perturbations, which hold a cut-off at small scales, and explored their effects
on the non-linear structure formation at small and intermediate scales. We
generated mock catalogues of galaxies for different models and classify HCGs by
implementing an algorithm that adapts the original selection method for mock
catalogues. Once the HCGs samples are classified, we analyzed their properties
and compared them between models. We found that a larger amount of HCGs are
counted in GDM simulations in comparison to CDM counts. This difference
suggests that HCGs can proliferate within GDM despite the suppressed
substructure, which indicates a possible modification in the HCG formation
process within models where DM is not perfectly like CDM. Additionally, we
identified different mechanisms of clustering, for models with a large amount
of galaxy-halos self-agglomerate because of their abundance while models with
fewer galaxy-halos need massive halos acting as a dominant potential well.

data uses two-point correlations as its primary statistic; MFs, morphological
statistics describing the shape of matter fields, provide additional
information for non-Gaussian fields. Previous analyses have studied MFs of
lensing convergence maps; in this project we explore their simultaneous
application to clustering maps. We employ a simplified linear galaxy bias
model, and using a lognormal curved sky measurement and Monte Carlo Markov
Chain (MCMC) sampling process for parameter inference, we find that MFs do not
yield any information in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$ -- $\sigma_8$ plane not already

constraining power when nonlinear baryonic and other small-scale effects are

spectroscopy. The Rubin Observatory, Euclid, and Roman Space Telescope will
soon provide a new generation of imaging surveys with unprecedented area
coverage, wavelength range, and depth. To take full advantage of these
datasets, further progress in photometric redshift methods is needed. In this
review, we focus on the greatest common challenges and prospects for
improvement in applications of photo-$z$'s to the next generation of surveys:
  - Gains in $performance$ -- i.e., the precision of redshift estimates for
individual galaxies -- could greatly enhance studies of galaxy evolution and
some probes of cosmology.
  - Improvements in $characterization$ -- i.e., the accurate recovery of
redshift $distributions$ of galaxies in the presence of uncertainty on
individual redshifts -- are urgently needed for cosmological measurements with
next-generation surveys.
  - To achieve both of these goals, improvements in the scope and treatment of
the samples of spectroscopic redshifts which make high-fidelity photo-$z$'s
possible will also be needed.
  For the full potential of the next generation of surveys to be reached, the
characterization of redshift distributions will need to improve by roughly an
order of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, requiring progress
on a wide variety of fronts. We conclude by presenting a speculative evaluation
of how photometric redshift methods and the collection of the necessary
spectroscopic samples may improve by the time near-future surveys are

accurately calculate the dark matter relative velocity distribution, and find
that it allows us to estimate the dark matter annihilation signal without the

the standard Amati correlation only give a lower bound limit on the present
matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}}$, while the GRBs from the
improved Amati correlation constrain the $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}}$ with the $68\%$

goal: analyzing the distribution of particles at `microscales' to predict
physical properties at `macroscales', whether for a liquid, composite material,
or entire Universe. The former theory provides an array of techniques to
characterize a wide class of microstructures; in this work, we apply them to
the distributions of galaxies. We focus on the lower-order correlation
functions, `void' and `particle' nearest-neighbor functions, pair-connectedness
functions, percolation properties, and a scalar order metric. Compared to
homogeneous Poisson and typical disordered systems, the cosmological
simulations exhibit enhanced large-scale clustering and longer tails in the
nearest-neighbor functions, due to the presence of quasi-long-range
correlations. On large scales, the system appears `hyperuniform', due to
primordial density fluctuations, whilst on the smallest scales, the system
becomes almost `antihyperuniform', and, via the order metric, is shown to be a
highly correlated disordered system. Via a finite scaling analysis, we show
that the percolation threshold of the galaxy catalogs is significantly lower
than for Poisson realizations; this is consistent with the observation that the
galaxy distribution contains larger voids. However, the two sets of simulations

we investigate the number count dipole induced by primordial perturbations with

that neither adiabatic nor isocurvature superhorizon modes can generate an
intrinsic number count dipole. However a superhorizon isocurvature mode does
induce a relative velocity between the CMB and the (dark) matter rest frames
and thereby affects the CMB dipole. We revisit the possibility that it has an
intrinsic component due to such a mode, thus enabling consistency with the
galaxy number count dipole if the latter is actually kinematic in origin.
Although this scenario is not particularly natural, there are possible links
with other anomalies and it predicts a concommitant galaxy number count
quadrupole which may be measurable in future surveys. We also investigate the
number count dipole induced by modes smaller than the Hubble radius, finding
that subject to CMB constraints this is too small to reconcile the dipole

isotropic states under conditions more general than those to which Wald's
theorem applies. We construct an effective field theory (EFT) treatment for
generic ``single-clock"" systems in anisotropic spacetimes -- which are not
limited to realizations compatible with scalar-field constructions -- and
identify fixed points in the resulting phase space. We identify regions of this
phase space that flow to isotropic fixed points -- including a de Sitter fixed
point -- even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant, and for matter
sources that do not obey the energy conditions required for Wald's theorem.

depends on secondary effects, such as the size of the clusters and their
dynamical state. The cool core bias mostly affects faint clusters classified as
point sources, while its impact on the extent-selected sample is small. The
measured X-ray luminosity of the detected clusters is compatible with the
simulated values. We discuss how to best build samples of galaxy clusters for
cosmological purposes, accounting for the nonuniform depth of eROSITA. This

$G_F$ which determines the strength of the electroweak decay. To probe it, we
use SNe Ia light curves as a source of reliable primordial nucleosynthesis
events across the redshifts. We utilized studies suggesting that in the initial
phase of the SNe Ia explosion, the electroweak decay of $Ni^{56}
\longrightarrow Co^{56}$ is the key contributor to the power of the SNe Ia
light curve. We hence used the Pan-STARRS supernovae catalog having 1169
supernovae light curves in $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ spectral filters and related
the dimming of light curves from their peak with the electroweak decay rate of
primordial nucleosynthesis and further with $G_F$. To keep the analysis
independent of the cosmological model, we used the Hubble parameter measurement
and a non-parametric statistical method, the Gaussian process. Our study puts a
strong upper bound on the present value of the fractional change in the Fermi
coupling constant i.e; $\frac{\dot G_F}{G_F} \approx 10^{-12} yr^{-1}$ using

the redshift range $0.127 \le z \le 0.449$, in a tomographic approach, with the
main goal of probing BAO. This work presents the forecasts of measuring the
transversal BAO signal during the BINGO Phase 1 operation. We use two
clustering estimators, the two-point angular correlation function (ACF) and the
angular power spectrum (APS), and a template-based method to model the ACF and
APS estimated from simulations of the BINGO region and extract the BAO
information. The tomographic approach allows the combination of redshift bins
to improve the template fitting performance. We find that each clustering
estimator shows different sensitivities to specific redshift ranges, although
both of them perform better at higher redshifts. In general, the APS estimator
provides slightly better estimates, with smaller uncertainties and larger
probability of detection of the BAO signal, achieving $\gtrsim 90$\% at higher
redshifts. We investigate the contribution from instrumental noise and residual
foreground signals and find that the former has the greater impact, getting
more significant as the redshift increases, in particular the APS estimator.
Indeed, including noise in the analysis increases the uncertainty up to a
factor of $\sim 2.2$ at higher redshifts. Foreground residuals, in contrast, do
not significantly affect our final uncertainties. In summary, our results show
that, even including semi-realistic systematic effects, BINGO has the potential
to successfully measure the BAO scale in radio frequencies. (Abridged)"

show correlations between reionization time and overdensities and object masses

parameter, this paper focuses solely on the properties of paired halos within
the same mass range as the Milky Way. For this purpose, it uses CoDaII, a
fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamics reionization simulation of the local
Universe. This simulation holds a halo pair representing the Local Group, in
addition to other pairs, sharing similar mass, mass ratio, distance separation
and isolation criteria but in other environments, alongside isolated halos
within the same mass range. Investigations of the paired halo reionization
histories reveal a wide diversity although always inside-out given our
reionization model. Within this model, halos in a close pair tend to be
reionized at the same time but being in a pair does not bring to an earlier
time their mean reionization. The only significant trend is found between the
total energy at z = 0 of the pairs and their mean reionization time: pairs with
the smallest total energy (bound) are reionized up to 50 Myr earlier than
others (unbound). Above all, this study reveals the variety of reionization
histories undergone by halo pairs similar to the Local Group, that of the Local
Group being far from an average one. In our model, its reionization time is

estimator, and an independent and fast pipeline based on EFTofLSS implemented

accelerate our analysis by using the BACCO linear emulator instead of a
Boltzmann solver. We perform two sets of analyses: one with $3\sigma$ Planck
priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$, and another that is CMB-free, without such priors.
Firstly, we study $\Lambda$CDM, reproducing previous results obtained with the
same estimator. We find a low value of $A_s$ in the CMB-free case, in agreement
with many previous analyses of the BOSS data. We then study $w$CDM, finding a
lower value of the amplitude in the CMB-free run, coupled with a preference for
phantom dark energy with $w=-1.17^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$, again in broad agreement
with previous results. Finally, we investigate the dark scattering model, which
we label $wA$CDM. In the CMB-free analysis, we find a large degeneracy between
the interaction strength $A$ and the amplitude $A_s$, hampering measurements of
those parameters. On the contrary, in our run with a CMB prior, we are able to
constrain the dark energy parameters to be $w=-0.972^{+0.036}_{-0.029}$ and $A
= 3.9^{+3.2}_{-3.7}$, which show a 1$\sigma$ hint of interacting dark energy.
This is the first measurement of this parameter and demonstrates the ability of
this model to alleviate the $\sigma_8$ tension. Our analysis can be used as a
guide for any model with scale-independent growth. Finally, we study the
dependence of the results on the priors of the nuisance parameters and find
these priors to be informative, with their broadening creating shifts in the
contours. We argue for an in depth study of this issue, which can affect
current and forthcoming analyses of LSS data."

Iye et al (2021) applied
a 3D analysis to a dataset of bright SDSS galaxies that was used in the past
for photometric analysis. They showed that the distribution of spin directions
of spiral galaxies is random, providing a dipole axis with low statistical
significance of 0.29$\sigma$. However, to show random distribution, two
decisions were made, each can lead to random distribution regardless of the
real distribution of the spin direction of galaxies. The first decision was to
limit the dataset arbitrarily to z$<$0.1, which is a redshift range in which
previous literature already showed that random distribution is expected. More
importantly, while the 3D analysis requires the redshift of each galaxy, the
analysis was done with the photometric redshift. If the asymmetry existed, its
signal is expected to be an order of magnitude weaker than the error of the
photometric redshift, and therefore the low statistical signal under these
conditions is expected. When using the exact same data without limiting to
$z_{phot}<0.1$ and without using the photometric redshift, the distribution of
the spin directions in that dataset shows a statistical signal of $>2\sigma$.
Code and data for reproducing the analysis are publicly available. These
results are in agreement with other experiments with SDSS, Pan-STARRS, HST, and

directions of 739,286 galaxies imaged by DES. The distribution of the spin
directions of the galaxies exhibits a large-scale dipole axis. Comparison of
the location of the dipole axis to a similar analysis with data from SDSS,
Pan-STARRS, and DESI Legacy Survey shows that all sky surveys exhibit dipole
axes within 52$^o$ or less from each other, well within 1$\sigma$ error. While
non-random distribution is unexpected, the findings are consistent across all
sky surveys, regardless of the telescope or whether the data were annotated
manually or automatically. Possible errors that can lead to the observation are
discussed. The paper also discusses previous studies showing opposite
conclusions,and analyzes the decisions that led to these results. Although the
observation is provocative, and further research will be required, the existing
evidence justifies to consider the contention that galaxy spin directions as
observed from Earth are not necessarily randomly distributed. Possible
explanations can be related to mature cosmological theories, but also to the
internal structure of galaxies."

with cosmic strings being the best motivated example. While in most cases one
studies Nambu-Goto or Abelian-Higgs strings, one also expects that
cosmologically realistic strings should have additional degrees of freedom in
their worldsheets, one specific example being superstrings from Type IIB
superstring theory. Here we continue the scientific exploitation of our
recently developed multi-GPU field theory cosmic strings code to study the
evolution of U(1)$\times$U(1) multitension networks, which are a numerically
convenient proxy: these contain two lowest-tension strings networks able to
interact and form bound states, providing a convenient first approximation to
the behaviour expected from cosmic superstrings. (...) We rely on the largest
field theory simulations of this model so far, specifically $4096^3$, $\Delta x
= 0.5$ boxes. We present robust evidence of scaling for the lightest strings,
measured through a complete and self-consistent set of correlation length and
velocity diagnostics. We also find a linearly growing average length of the
bound state segments, consistent with a scaling behaviour. (In previously
reported lower-resolution simulations, such behaviour had only been identified
with carefully engineered initial conditions, rich in those segments.) Finally,
while we see no evidence of a large population of bound states forming at early
stages of the network evolution, we do present tentative evidence for an
asymptotic constant value of the fraction of bound states, with this value
being different in the radiation and the matter eras. Our work demonstrates
that our GPU-accelerated field theory code can by successfully extended beyond
the simple Abelian-Higgs approximation, and enables future detailed studies of
realistic string networks and of their observational signatures."

field, and are well suited for measuring the redshift space distortion (RSD)
signal in large scale structure catalogs. We consider how the linear RSD signal
can be extracted from a field without resorting to the plane parallel
approximation. A spherically redshift space distorted field is both anisotropic
and inhomogeneous. We derive expressions for the two point correlation
functions that elucidate the inhomogeneity, and then explain how the breakdown
of homogeneity impacts the volume and ensemble averages of the tensor Minkowski
functionals. We construct the ensemble average of these quantities in
curvilinear coordinates and show that the ensemble and volume averages can be
approximately equated, but this depends on our choice of definition of the
volume average of a tensor and the radial distance between the observer and
field. We then extract the tensor Minkowski functionals from spherically
redshift space distorted, Gaussian random fields and gravitationally evolved
dark matter density fields at $z=0$ to test if we can successfully measure the
Kaiser RSD signal. For the dark matter field we find a significant, $\sim 10\%$
anomalous signal in the MT component parallel to the line of sight that is
present even on large scales $R_{\rm G} \gtrsim 15 \, {\rm Mpc}$, in addition
to the Kaiser effect. This is due to the line of sight component of the MT

supernova (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) from the recently updated sample
of SNe Ia in nearby galaxies with distances measured via Cepheid
period-luminosity relations by the SHOES project. We collect public
near-infrared photometry of up to 19 calibrator SNe Ia and further 57 SNe Ia in
the Hubble flow ($z>0.01$), and directly measure their peak magnitudes in the
$J$ and $H$ band by Gaussian processes and spline interpolation. Calibrator
peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances are used to estimate the
average absolute magnitude in each band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to
constrain the zero-point intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our
baseline result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $J$ band and $72.3\pm1.3$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $H$ band, where the systematic uncertainties include the
standard deviation of up to 21 variations of the analysis, the 0.7\% distance
scale systematic from SHOES Cepheid anchors, a photometric zeropoint
systematic, and a cosmic variance systematic. Our final measurement represents
a measurement with a precision of 2.8\% in both bands. The variant with the
largest change in $H_0$ is when limiting the sample to SNe from CSP and CfA
programmes, noteworthy because these are the best calibrated, yielding
$H_0\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in both bands. We demonstrate stretch and
reddening corrections are still useful in the NIR to standardize SN Ia NIR peak
magnitudes. Based on our results, in order to improve the precision of the
$H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the future, we would need to
increase the number of calibrator SNe Ia, be able to extend the
Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram to higher-z, and include standardization procedures
to help reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter."

amplitude of matter clustering at higher redshifts, as probed by lensing of the

connection between the $S_8$ tension and the transition from matter to
dark-energy domination. Here we show that the tension can be resolved by
introducing a friction between dark matter and dark energy without altering the
tightly constrained expansion history. The low-$S_8$ measurements favor (at

head of the astrophysics sector at the Astronomical Observatory of the
University, was a professor of department for theoretical physics as well as
the founder and head of a station for optical observations of artificial
satellites of Earth. He was active in the organization of the astronomical
observational site outside of the city. During the years in Lviv, Kaplan wrote

at that time was on stability of circular orbits in the Schwarzschild field, on
white dwarf theory, on space gas dynamics, and cosmic plasma physics, and
turbulence, on acceleration of cosmic rays, on physics of interstellar medium,
on physics and evolution of stars, on cosmology and gravitation, and on optical

cosmic dipole measured from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), as well as
from the number count of quasars and radio sources. These measurements are
currently in tension, with the number count dipole being 2-5 times larger than
expected from CMB measurements. This discrepancy has been pointed out as a
possible indication that the cosmological principle is not valid. In this
paper, we explore the possibility of detecting and estimating the cosmic dipole
with gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers detected by the
future next-generation detectors Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We
model the expected signal and show that for binary black holes, the dipole
amplitude in the number count of detections is independent of the
characteristics of the population and provides a systematic-free tool to
estimate the observer velocity. We introduce techniques to detect the cosmic
dipole from number counting of GW detections and estimate its significance. We
show that a GW dipole consistent with the amplitude of the dipole in radio
galaxies would be detectable with $>3\sigma$ significance with a few years of
observation ($10^6$ GW detections) and estimated with a $16\%$ precision, while
a GW dipole consistent with the CMB one would require at least $10^7$ GW events

to explain this. However, such a high star formation efficiency would greatly
increase the number of ionizing photons, which would be in serious conflict
with current cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements of cosmic
reionization history. To solve this problem, we explore the fuzzy dark matter
(FDM), which is composed of ultra-light scalar particles, e.g. ultra-light
axions, and calculate its halo mass function and stellar mass density for
different axion masses. We find that the FDM model can effectively suppress the
formation of small halos and galaxies, so that with higher star formation
efficiency, both the JWST data at $z\sim8$ and the optical depth of CMB
scattering can be simultaneously matched. We find that an axion mass $m_a\simeq
5\times10^{-23}$ and $10^{-21}\ \rm eV$ are needed to fit the Planck and WMAP
results, respectively. We also find that the JWST data at $z\sim10$ are still
too high to fit in this scenario. We note that the estimated mean redshift of
the sample may have large uncertainty, that it can be as low as $z\sim9$
depending on adopted spectral energy distribution (SED) templates and
photometric-redshift code. Besides, the warm dark matter with $\sim$keV mass
can also be an alternative choice, since it should have similar effects on halo

algorithm, we identify optical counterparts, determine photometric redshifts
and richnesses and assign a parameter, $f_{\rm cont}$, that reflects the
probability that each SZE-optical pairing represents a real cluster rather than
a random superposition of physically unassociated systems. The new MADPSZ
cluster catalogue consists of 1092 MCMF confirmed clusters and has a purity of
85%. We present the properties of subsamples of the MADPSZ catalogue that have
purities ranging from 90% to 97.5%, depending on the adopted $f_{\rm cont}$
threshold. $M_{500}$ halo mass estimates, redshifts, richnesses, and optical
centers are presented for all MADPSZ clusters. The MADPSZ catalogue adds 828
previously unknown Planck identified clusters over the DES footprint and
provides redshifts for an additional 50 previously published Planck selected
clusters with S/N>4.5. Using the subsample with spectroscopic redshifts, we
demonstrate excellent cluster photo-$z$ performance with an RMS scatter in
$\Delta z/(1+z)$ of 0.47%. Our MCMF based analysis allows us to infer the
contamination fraction of the initial S/N>3 Planck selected candidate list,
which is 50%. We present a method of estimating the completeness of the MADPSZ
cluster sample and $f_{\rm cont}$ selected subsamples. In comparison to the
previously published Planck cluster catalogues. this new S/N $>$ 3 MCMF
confirmed cluster catalogue populates the lower mass regime at all redshifts

is based on a fluid approximation of the underlying Vlasov-Poisson dynamics,
taking only the zeroth and first cumulant of the phase-space distribution
function into account (density and velocity fields). This assumption breaks
down when dark matter particle orbits cross and leads to well-known problems,
e.g. an anomalously large backreaction of small-scale modes onto larger scales
that compromises predictivity. We extend SPT by incorporating second and higher
cumulants generated by orbit crossing. For collisionless matter, their
equations of motion are completely fixed by the Vlasov-Poisson system, and thus
we refer to this approach as Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT). Even cumulants
develop a background value, and they enter the hierarchy of coupled equations
for the fluctuations. The background values are in turn sourced by power
spectra of the fluctuations. The latter can be brought into a form that is
formally analogous to SPT, but with an extended set of variables and linear as
well as non-linear terms, that we derive explicitly. In this paper, we focus on
linear solutions, which are far richer than in SPT, showing that modes that
cross the dispersion scale set by the second cumulant are highly suppressed. We
derive stability conditions on the background values of even cumulants from the
requirement that exponential instabilities be absent. We also compute the
expected magnitude of averaged higher cumulants for various halo models and
show that they satisfy the stability conditions. Finally, we derive
self-consistent solutions of perturbations and background values for a scaling
universe and study the convergence of the cumulant expansion. The VPT framework
provides a conceptually straightforward and deterministic extension of SPT that
accounts for the decoupling of small-scale modes."

previously unidentified common mode systematic in the data set. If not
accounted for, this systematic introduces an overall \emph{negative} bias that
can make foreground contaminated measurements appear as stringent,
noise-limited constraints on the 21 cm signal amplitude. The identification of
this systematic highlights the risk in modeling systematics as
positive-definite contributions to the power spectrum and in ``conservatively''
interpreting all measurements as upper limits."

models, two pairs allowing for non-flat spatial hypersurfaces with CMB
temperature and polarization power spectrum data (P18) from Planck, P18 lensing
(lensing), and non-CMB data (non-CMB). For the six models, we measure
cosmological parameters and study whether or not pairs of the data sets are
mutually consistent in these models. Half of these models allow the lensing
consistency parameter $A_L$ to be an additional free parameter, while the other
three have $A_L = 1$. The tilted spatially-flat models assume the usual
primordial spatial inhomogeneity power spectrum. The tilted non-flat models
assume either the primordial power spectrum used in the Planck group analyses
[Planck $P(q)$] or a recently computed power spectrum [new $P(q)$]. In the
tilted non-flat models with $A_L=1$ we find differences between P18 data and
non-CMB data cosmological parameter constraints, which are large enough to rule
out the Planck $P(q)$ model at 3$\sigma$ but not the new $P(q)$ model. While
both P18 data and non-CMB data separately favor a closed geometry when
P18+non-CMB data are jointly analyzed the evidence in favor of non-flat
hypersurfaces subsides. Differences between P18 data and non-CMB data
cosmological constraints subside when $A_L$ is allowed to vary. From the most
restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data combination we get almost
model-independent constraints and find that the $A_L>1$ option is preferred
over the $\Omega_k<0$ one, with the $A_L$ parameter, for all models, being
larger than unity by $\sim 2.5\sigma$. According to the deviance information
criterion, in the P18+lensing+non-CMB analysis, the varying $A_L$ option is on
the verge of being strongly favored over the $A_L=1$ one, which could indicate
a problem for the standard tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model (Abridged abstract)."

grand unified theories (GUTs). We investigate the cosmic dynamics and discover
that the domain walls act as either dark energy or dark matter at different
times, depending on the velocity v in the observer's comoving frame. We find a
single stable solution to the dynamics, i.e., only freezing (v = 0)
noncanonical domain walls can enter the phantom zone without having to
experience ghost field instability. This means that the solution has an
equation of state (EoS) w_dw < -1 without having to possess negative kinetic
energy. These domain walls give rise to a late-time cosmic acceleration
starting from z = 0.8, resulting in w_dw = -1.5 and w_eff = -1.03 today. We
learn that the EoS of the noncanonical domain walls is independent of the
potential form. We also investigate the perturbation dynamics following the
model. Our simulations show that compared to LCDM, the amplitude of the dark
matter power spectrum in the noncanonical domain wall model is lower, while the
CMB power spectrum is shifted slighly to lower l multipoles. The proposed model
gives a smaller sigma8 compared to that of LCDM."

constrain the tensor to scalar ratio $r$, a parameter that quantifies the
amplitude of inflationary gravity waves. We carry out map-based component
separation on simulations with five foreground models and input $r$ values
$r_{in}=0$ and $r_{in} = 0.003$. We forecast $r$ determinations using a
Gaussian likelihood assuming either no delensing or a residual lensing factor
$A_{\rm lens}$ = 27%. By implementing the first full-sky, post
component-separation, map-domain delensing, we show that PICO should be able to
achieve $A_{\rm lens}$ = 22% - 24%. For four of the five foreground models we
find that PICO would be able to set the constraints $r < 1.3 \times 10^{-4}
\,\, \mbox{to} \,\, r <2.7 \times 10^{-4}\, (95\%)$ if $r_{in}=0$, the
strongest constraints of any foreseeable instrument. For these models,
$r=0.003$ is recovered with confidence levels between $18\sigma$ and
$27\sigma$. We find weaker, and in some cases significantly biased, upper
limits when removing few low or high frequency bands. The fifth model gives a
$3\sigma$ detection when $r_{in}=0$ and a $3\sigma$ bias with $r_{in} = 0.003$.
However, by correlating $r$ determinations from many small 2.5% sky areas with
the mission's 555 GHz data we identify and mitigate the bias. This analysis
underscores the importance of large sky coverage. We show that when only low
multipoles $\ell \leq 12$ are used, the non-Gaussian shape of the true

varying both nuisance parameters and cosmology, including a conservative range
of scales. Fixing cosmological parameters and quadratic bias parameter
relations, the limits tighten significantly to $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

favorably with the forecasted bounds from CMB-S4: $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

constraint of $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq})\approx 14$, $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

from the Simons Observatory. We additionally perform a range of Fisher analyses
for the error, forecasting the dependence on nuisance parameter
marginalization, scale cuts, and survey strategy. Lack of knowledge of bias and
counterterm parameters is found to significantly limit the information content;
this could be ameliorated by tight simulation-based priors on the nuisance
parameters. The error-bars decrease significantly as the number of observed
galaxies and survey depth is increased: as expected, deep dense surveys are the
most constraining, though it will be difficult to reach $\sigma(f_{\rm

functions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in the perturbed Universe,
following up on paper I and II in this series. We illustrate the physical
effects inherent to the solutions, discussing and demonstrating various
limiting cases for the perturbed photon spectrum. We clarify the relationship
between distortion transfer functions and the photon spectrum itself, providing
the machinery that can then compute constrainable CMB signal power spectra
including spectral distortions for single energy injection and decaying
particle scenarios. Our results show that the $\mu \times T$ and $y\times T$
power spectra reach levels that can be constrained with current and future CMB
experiments without violating existing constraints from COBE/FIRAS. The
amplitude of the cross-correlation signal directly depends on the average
distortion level, therefore establishing a novel fundamental link between the
state of the primordial plasma from redshift $10^3 \lesssim z\lesssim 3\times
10^6$ and the frequency-dependent CMB sky. This provides a new method to
constrain average early energy release using CMB imagers. As an example we
derive constraints on single energy release and decaying particle scenarios.
This shows that LiteBIRD may be able to improve the energy release limits of
COBE/FIRAS by up to a factor of $\simeq 2.5$, while PICO could tighten the
constraints by more than one order of magnitude. The signals considered here
could furthermore provide a significant challenge to reaching cosmic
variance-limited constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from distortion
anisotropy studies. Our work further highlights the immense potential for a
synergistic spectroscopic approach to future CMB measurements and analyses."

the bath couplings to degrees of freedom within or beyond the Standard Model

initial misaligned (ALP) condensate, thermalization with the bath, decoherence

$\mathcal{E}(t)$ features two components: a ``cold'' component from the
misaligned condensate and a ``hot'' component from thermalization with the
bath, with $\mathcal{E}(t)=
\mathcal{E}_{c}\,e^{-\gamma(T)\,t}+\mathcal{E}_{h}(1-e^{-\gamma(T)\,t})$ thus
providing a ``mixed dark matter'' scenario. Relaxation of the (ALP) condensate,
thermalization, decoherence and entropy production occur on similar time
scales. An explicit example with (ALP)-photon coupling, valid post
recombination yields a relaxation rate $\gamma(T)$ with a substantial
enhancement from thermal emission and absorption. A misaligned condensate is
decaying at least since recombination and on the same time scale thermalizing
with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Possible consequences for
birefringence of the (CMB) and (ALP) contribution to the effective number of
ultrarelativistic species and galaxy formation are discussed."

                                              One of the main scientiÔ¨Åc goals of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is to explore

Raikov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vladimir Yershov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yuri Lovyagin')]","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has recently become operational,
is capable of detecting objects at record-breaking redshifts, $z \gtrsim 15$.
This is a crucial advance for observational cosmology, as at these redshifts
the differences between alternative cosmological models manifest themselves in
the most obvious way. In recent years, some observational hints have emerged
indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require correcting. One
of these hints is related to the discovery of remote galaxies whose redshifts
correspond to the very young Universe (less than one billion years after the
Big Bang) but which are similar to nearby galaxies. The issue is that such
galaxies in the early Universe do not have enough time to evolve into something
similar to the late-Universe galaxies. JWST observations of high-redshift
objects are expected to shed light on the origin of this issue. Here we provide
results on performing the ``angular diameter -- redshift'' cosmological test
for the first JWST observation data. We compare this result with predictions of
the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and some static cosmological
models, including Zwicky's ``tired-light'' model. The latter is currently
assumed to be ruled out by observations. We challenge this assumption and show
that a static model can provide a natural and straightforward way of solving
the puzzle of the well-evolved galaxies and better agreements with the results
of the JWST ``angular diameter -- redshift'' test at higher redshifts than the
correcting evolution model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We discuss
several cosmological tests that will be important for further research on the
possibility of revising the expanding Universe paradigm."

the baryon on the 21cm forest signals. The DM-baryon relative velocity arises
due to their different evolutions before the baryon-photon decoupling epoch and
it gives an additional anisotropic pressure that can suppress the perturbation
growth. It is intriguing that the scales $k\sim {\cal O}(10\sim
10^3)h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ at which the matter power spectrum is affected by such a
streaming velocity turns out to be the scale at which the 21cm forest signal is
sensitive to. We demonstrate that the 21cm absorption line abundance can
decrease by more than a factor of a few due to the small-scale matter power
spectrum suppression caused by the DM-baryon relative velocity."

in which the vacuum energy interacts with matter and radiation, and test this
model using the current cosmological observations. We find that this model can
significantly relieve the $H_0$ tension, and at the same time it can also
slightly reduce the $S_8$ tension, which cannot be easily observed in other
cosmological models. Using the CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) data to constrain the model, we
obtain the results of $H_0=70.6^{+1.4}_{-1.7}~\rm{km~s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and
$S_8=0.820\pm 0.011$, and thus the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to
$1.28\sigma$ and $2.67\sigma$, respectively. However, in this case the
$\tilde\Lambda$CDM model is not favored by the data, compared with
$\Lambda$CDM. We find that when the $H_0$ and $S_8$ data are added into the
data combination, the situation is significantly improved. In the CBS+$H_0$
case, we obtain the result of $H_0=72.2\pm 1.2$ ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$,
which relieves the $H_0$ tension to $0.53\sigma$, and in this case the model is
favored over $\Lambda$CDM. In the CBS+$H_0$+$S_8$ case, we get a synthetically
best situation, $H_0=71.9\pm 1.1$ ${\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8=0.8071\pm
0.0099$, in which the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relived to $0.75\sigma$ and
$2.09\sigma$, respectively. In this case, the model is most favored by the

tension, and at the same time it can also effectively alleviate the $S_8$
tension."
