extensive and wide-ranging, there have been very few attempts to quantify and
measure localised financial exclusion anywhere in the world. This is a subject
of growing importance in modern UK society with the withdrawal of cash
infrastructure and a shift towards online banking. This research develops a
composite indicator using a wide-range of input variables, including the
locations of existing cash infrastructure, various demographic factors (such as
income and housing tenure) and other freely available lifestyle data to
identify areas at greatest risk of financial exclusion, thereby aiding
organisations to develop intervention strategies to tackle the problem. The
indicator illustrates that whilst there is no apparent correlation between
financial exclusion and deprivation, pockets of extreme financial exclusion are
generally found in deprived communities, and affluent, suburban areas tend to
score consistently more favourably and consequently carry less risk. The
attributing causes vary, from a lack of infrastructure, to low car
availability, but income levels have a pronounced influence. Three policy
proposals are put forward, including offering banking services at PayPoint
outlets, and converting cash machines to cash recyclers, but improving digital
adoption was found to be the most effective intervention, provided that it is
implemented by community organisations. Policies purely targeting
infrastructure provision or addressing social exclusion are unlikely to be
effective, as community-based initiatives coupled with wider reforms to the
financial system are needed."

examines the impact of hydropower on system electricity price and price
volatility in the region served by the New England Independent System Operator
(ISONE) from 2014 - 2020. We perform a robust holistic analysis of the mean and
quantile effects, as well as the marginal contributing effects of hydropower in
the presence of solar and wind resources. First, the price data is adjusted for
deterministic temporal trends, correcting for seasonal, weekend, and diurnal
effects that may obscure actual representative trends in the data. Using
multiple linear regression and quantile regression, we observe that hydropower
contributes to a reduction in the system electricity price and price
volatility. While hydropower has a weak impact on decreasing price and
volatility at the mean, it has greater impact at extreme quantiles (> 70th
percentile). At these higher percentiles, we find that hydropower provides a
stabilizing effect on price volatility in the presence of volatile resources
such as wind. We conclude with a discussion of the observed relationship
between hydropower and system electricity price and volatility."

APPENDIX A: CLIMATE RISK PRICING

         We have developed a conceptual framework for estimating the speed and magnitude of the
pricing-in of climate risk.",2022-07-05 14:15:19+00:00,Climate-Contingent Finance,q-fin.GN,"['q-fin.GN', 'econ.GN', 'q-fin.EC']",[arxiv.Result.Author('John Nay')],"Climate adaptation could yield significant benefits. However, the uncertainty
of which future climate scenarios will occur decreases the feasibility of
proactively adapting. Climate adaptation projects could be underwritten by
benefits paid for in the climate scenarios that each adaptation project is
designed to address because other entities would like to hedge the financial
risk of those scenarios. Because the return on investment is a function of the
level of climate change, it is optimal for the adapting entity to finance
adaptation with repayment as a function of the climate. It is also optimal for
entities with more financial downside under a more extreme climate to serve as
an investing counterparty because they can obtain higher than market rates of
return when they need it most.
  In this way, parties proactively adapting would reduce the risk they
over-prepare, while their investors would reduce the risk they under-prepare.
This is superior to typical insurance because, by investing in
climate-contingent mechanisms, investors are not merely financially hedging but
also outright preventing physical damage, and therefore creating economic
value. This coordinates capital through time and place according to parties'
risk reduction capabilities and financial profiles, while also providing a
diversifying investment return.
  Climate-contingent finance can be generalized to any situation where entities
share exposure to a risk where they lack direct control over whether it occurs
(e.g., climate change, or a natural pandemic), and one type of entity can take
proactive actions to benefit from addressing the effects of the risk if it
occurs (e.g., through innovating on crops that would do well under extreme
climate change or vaccination technology that could address particular viruses)
with funding from another type of entity that seeks a targeted return to
ameliorate the downside."

environmental management accounting in the manufacturing companies is in poor
level. The maximum compliance is 67% and the lowest is 20%. The TA, TS BS and
