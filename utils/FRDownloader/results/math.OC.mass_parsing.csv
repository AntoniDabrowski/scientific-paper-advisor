domination problems. For each problem we propose two integer linear programming
(ILP) formulations, the constraint programming (CP) formulation and variable
neighborhood search (VNS) method. We present proofs for the correctness of the
ILP formulations and a polyhedral study in which we show that the polyhedrons
of the two model relaxations are equivalent.
  VNS uses specifically designed penalty function that allows the appearance of
slightly infeasible solutions. The acceptance of these solutions directs the
overall search process to the promising areas in the long run.
  All proposed approaches are tested on the large number of instances.
Experimental results indicate that all of them reach optimal solutions for the
most of small and middle scale instances. Both ILP models have proven to be
more successful than the other two methods."

hard cases generated by our framework to design defense models, such as adversarial training and
hyperparameter tuning.","The solution quality of the commercial solver Gurobi can

tasks for upper-stream applications in data mining, machine learning and
operations research. Despite the inherent NP-hard challenge for CO, heuristics,
branch-and-bound, learning-based solvers are developed to tackle CO problems as
accurately as possible given limited time budgets. However, a practical metric
for the sensitivity of CO solvers remains largely unexplored. Existing
theoretical metrics require the optimal solution which is infeasible, and the
gradient-based adversarial attack metric from deep learning is not compatible
with non-learning solvers that are usually non-differentiable. In this paper,
we develop the first practically feasible robustness metric for general
combinatorial optimization solvers. We develop a no worse optimal cost
guarantee thus do not require optimal solutions, and we tackle the
non-differentiable challenge by resorting to black-box adversarial attack
methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 14 unique combinations of
solvers and CO problems, and we demonstrate that the performance of
state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi can degenerate by over 20% under the given
time limit bound on the hard instances discovered by our robustness metric,
raising concerns about the robustness of combinatorial optimization solvers."

first-discretize-then-optimize approach together with A-stability. The notion
triplets emphasizes that these three different Peer methods have to satisfy
additional matching conditions. Four such Peer triplets of practical interest
are constructed. Also as a benchmark method, the well-known backward
differentiation formula BDF4, which is only $A(73.35^o)$-stable, is extended to
a special Peer triplet to supply an adjoint consistent method of higher order
and BDF type with equidistant nodes. Within the class of Peer triplets, we
found a diagonally implicit $A(84^o)$-stable method with nodes symmetric in
$[0,1]$ to a common center that performs equally well. Numerical tests with

an economic planner seeks to move an economy from one level of capital to
another, then the most efficient path, as long as the planner has enough time,
is to rapidly move stock to a level close to the optimal stationary or constant
path, then allow for capital to develop along that path until the desired term
is nearly reached, at which point the stock ought to be moved to the final
target. Motivated in part by its nature as a resource allocation strategy, over
the past decade, the turnpike property has also been shown to hold for several
classes of partial differential equations arising in mechanics. When formalized
mathematically, the turnpike theory corroborates the insights from economics:
for an optimal control problem set in a finite-time horizon, optimal controls
and corresponding states, are close (often exponentially), during most of the
time, except near the initial and final time, to the optimal control and
corresponding state for the associated stationary optimal control problem. In
particular, the former are mostly constant over time. This fact provides a
rigorous meaning to the asymptotic simplification that some optimal control
problems appear to enjoy over long time intervals, allowing the consideration
of the corresponding stationary problem for computing and applications. We
review a slice of the theory developed over the past decade --the
controllability of the underlying system is an important ingredient, and can

optimal--, and present several novel applications, including, among many

Specifically, the proposed scheme reduces the dimension of the product space

probabilistic distributions, with successful applications in various fields

Nevertheless, the high computational complexity is an obstacle for its
practical applications. The Sinkhorn algorithm, one of the main methods in
computing the Wasserstein metric, solves an entropy regularized minimizing
problem, which allows arbitrary approximations to the Wasserstein metric with
O(N^2) computational cost. However, higher accuracy of its numerical
approximation requires more Sinkhorn iterations with repeated matrix-vector
multiplications, which is still unaffordable. In this work, we propose an
efficient implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm to calculate the
Wasserstein-1 metric with O(N) computational cost, which achieves the optimal
theoretical complexity. By utilizing the special structure of Sinkhorn's
kernel, the repeated matrix-vector multiplications can be implemented with O(N)
times multiplications and additions, using the Qin Jiushao or Horner's method
for efficient polynomial evaluation, leading to an efficient algorithm without

Our framework is applied to analyze a class of proximal algorithms for
minimizing the sum of a piecewise smooth function and the difference between
the pointwise minimum of finitely many weakly-convex functions and a piecewise
smooth convex function. When realized on two-set feasibility problems, this
algorithm class recovers alternating projections and averaged projections as
special cases, and our framework thus equips these classical methods with
global convergence and possibilities for acceleration. By specializing the
framework to a feasibility problem reformulation of the linear complementarity
problem, we show global convergence to a solution with a local linear rate of
the alternating projection as well as the averaged projection methods.

assigns flow to paths where an arc failure or delay affects a whole path. We
provide a unifying framework by presenting novel general models, in which we
assign flow to subpaths. These models contain the known models as special cases
and unify their advantages in order to obtain less conservative robust
solutions. We give a thorough analysis with respect to complexity of the

NP-hard, whereas, e.g. in the static case with $\Gamma = 1$ an optimal solution
can be computed in polynomial time. Further, we answer the open question about

the DVRPSR as a multi-stage optimization problem, where the first-stage

contributions are knapsack-based linear models to approximate accurately the
expected reward-to-go, measured as the number of accepted requests, at any

each vehicle as a knapsack with a capacity given by the remaining service time
available along the vehicle's route. We combine these approximations with
optimal acceptance and assignment decision rules and derive efficient and
high-performing online scheduling policies. We further leverage good
predictions of the expected reward-to-go to design initial route plans that
facilitate serving dynamic requests. Computational experiments on very large

When the support of the control is not localized in $x_1$, namely, is of the
form $\omega=\mathbb{T}\times(c,d)$, we prove that the system is

respect to $x_1$, and controllability results which are uniform with respect to

resolvents of the operators are available, this problem can be tackled with the

one must work in a product space with as many factors as there are operators.
In groundbreaking recent work by Ryu and by Malitsky and Tam, it was shown that
the number of factors can be reduced by one. A similar reduction was achieved
recently by Campoy through a clever reformulation originally proposed by
Kruger. All three splitting methods guarantee weak convergence to some solution
of the underlying sum problem; strong convergence holds in the presence of
uniform monotonicity.
  In this paper, we provide a case study when the operators involved are normal
cone operators of subspaces and the solution set is thus the intersection of
the subspaces. Even though these operators lack strict convexity, we show that

geometric damping which is driven by the Hessian of the function to be

that the trajectories have at the same time several remarkable properties: they

Hessian-driven damping. The Tikhonov regularization parameter is assumed to
tend to zero as time tends to infinity, which preserves equilibria. The
presence of the Tikhonov regularization term induces a strong convexity
property which vanishes asymptotically. To take advantage of the exponential
convergence rates attached to the heavy ball method in the strongly convex
case, we consider the inertial dynamic where the viscous damping coefficient is
taken proportional to the square root of the Tikhonov regularization parameter,
and therefore also converges towards zero. Moreover, the dynamic involves a
geometric damping which is driven by the Hessian of the function to be
minimized, which induces a significant attenuation of the oscillations. Under
an appropriate tuning of the parameters, based on Lyapunov's analysis, we show
that the trajectories have at the same time several remarkable properties: they
provide fast convergence of values, fast convergence of gradients towards zero,
and strong convergence to the minimum norm minimizer. This study extends a
previous paper by the authors where similar issues were examined but without
the presence of Hessian driven damping."

first solves initial conflict by manipulating their speed and heading control
and then identifying each aircraft's optimal time to recover its trajectory
towards their nominal. The avoidance stage extends existing mixed-integer
programming formulations, and for the recovery stage, we propose a novel
mixed-integer formulation. We assume that speed and heading control are
continuous variables for this approach while the recovery time is treated as a

decomposition theorem guarantees the equivalence between the bigger subproblem
and these smaller ones. This paper focuses on convergence analysis, that is, we
prove that the sequence generated by the proposed method converges globally to
a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the considered problem. Finally, we do some

representation of a linear programming problem. This model makes it possible to
use artificial neural networks to solve multidimensional linear optimization
problems, the feasible region of which is a bounded non-empty set. To visualize
the linear programming problem, an objective hyperplane is introduced, the
orientation of which is determined by the gradient of the linear objective
function: the gradient is the normal to the objective hyperplane. In the case
of searching a maximum, the objective hyperplane is positioned in such a way
that the value of the objective function at all its points exceeds the value of
the objective function at all points of the feasible region, which is a bounded
convex polytope. For an arbitrary point of the objective hyperplane, the
objective projection onto the polytope is determined: the closer the objective
projection point is to the objective hyperplane, the greater the value of the
objective function at this point. Based on the objective hyperplane, a finite
regular set of points is constructed, called the receptive field. Using
objective projections, an image of a polytope is constructed. This image
includes the distances from the receptive points to the corresponding points of
the polytope surface. Based on the proposed model, parallel algorithms for
visualizing a linear programming problem are constructed. An analytical
estimation of its scalability is performed. Information about the software

Lattice Spring Model with infinitesimal strains and perfect plasticity. In
particular, we develop a highly efficient ""leapfrog"" computational framework

system based on the sweeping process theory. The utility of our framework is
demonstrated by analyzing the elastoplastic stresses in a novel class of
disordered network materials exhibiting the property of hyperuniformity, in
which the infinite wave-length density fluctuations associated with the
distribution of network nodes are completely suppressed. We find enhanced
mechanical properties such as increasing stiffness, yield strength and tensile
strength as the degree of hyperuniformity of the material system increases. Our
results have implications for optimal network material design and our
event-based framework can be readily generalized for nonlinear stress analysis

autonomous UAV volume coverage and visual inspection. The algorithm is an
extension of a state-of-the-art Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC)
multi-agent area coverage algorithm for three-dimensional domains. Given a
target coverage density field, the algorithm designs a potential field to
minimize the remaining density and generate trajectories using potential
gradients to direct UAVs to the regions with higher potential. Collisions
between agents and agents with domain boundaries are prevented by implementing
the distance field and correcting the agent's direction vector when the
distance threshold is reached. For visual inspection applications, the
algorithm is supplemented with the camera direction control. A field containing
the distance from any point in the domain to the structure surface is designed.
The gradient of the distance field is calculated to obtain the camera
orientation throughout the trajectory. Three different test cases of varying
complexities are considered to validate the proposed method for visual
inspection. The simplest scenario is a synthetic portal-like structure
inspected using three UAVs. The other two inspection scenarios are based on
realistic structures where UAVs are commonly used: a wind turbine and a bridge.
In the inspection of a wind turbine, two simulated UAVs traversing rather
smooth spiral trajectories successfully explore the entire turbine structure.
The bridge test case demonstrates effective visual inspection of the complex
structure and srves for comparison with the state-of-the-art in trajectory
planning where the HEDAC algorithm allowed more surface area to be inspected
under the same conditions. The limitations of the method are analyzed, focusing
on computational efficiency and adequacy of spatial coverage to approximate the
surface coverage."

well as two Nesterov-type extrapolated DCA -- ADCA (Phan et al.

valid inequalities are based on the notion of k-envelopes, can be computed

$\text{COP}_4=\mathcal{K}^{(0)}_4$ and that, while the union of the cones
$\mathcal{K}^{(r)}_n$ covers the interior of $\text{COP}_n$, it does not cover
the full cone $\text{COP}_n$ if $n\geq 6$. Here we investigate the remaining
case $n=5$, where all extreme rays have been fully characterized by Hildebrand
(The extreme rays of the 5 $\times$ 5 copositive cone. Linear Algebra and its
Applications, 437(7):1538--1547, 2012). We show that the Horn matrix $H$ and
its positive diagonal scalings play an exceptional role among the extreme rays
of $\text{COP}_5$. We show that equality $\text{COP}_5=\bigcup_{r\geq 0}
\mathcal{K}^{(r)}_5$ holds if and only if any positive diagonal scaling of $H$
belongs to $\mathcal{K}^{(r)}_5$ for some $r\in \mathbb{N}$. As a main
ingredient for the proof, we introduce new Lasserre-type conic inner
approximations for $\text{COP}_n$, based on sums of squares of polynomials. We
show their links to the cones $\mathcal{K}^{(r)}_n$, and we use an optimization
approach that permits to exploit finite convergence results on Lasserre
hierarchy to show membership in the new cones."

The KTNS algorithm is applied to compute the objective function value for the

the Job Sequencing and Tool Switching Problem (SSP). Our MPCA outperforms the
KTNS algorithm by at least an order of magnitude in terms of CPU times. Since

analysis of the system is performed using the principle of linearized stability

free equilibrium is unstable. This result justifies the developement of a
vaccination law. Two approaches are used. The first one is based on a
dicretization of the partial integro-differential equations (PIDE) model
according to the age. In this case a linearizing feedback law is found using
Isidori's theory. Conditions guaranteeing stability and positivity are
established. The second approach yields a linearizing feedback law developed
for the PIDE model. This law is deduced from the one obtained for the ODE case.
Using semigroup theory, stability conditions are also obtained. Finally,
numerical simulations are presented to reinforce the theoretical arguments."

their better energy efficiency when connecting DC components. However, they
might be unstable since many loads in a DC microgrid are regulated as constant
power loads (CPLs) that have a destabilizing negative impedance effect. As a
result, the state trajectory displacement caused by abrupt load changes or
contingencies can easily lead to instability. Many existing works have been
devoted to studying the region of attraction (ROA) of a DC microgrid, in which
the system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable. Nevertheless, existing
work either focuses on using numerical methods for ROA approximations that
generally have no performance guarantees or cannot ensure a desired ROA for a
general DC microgrid. To close this gap, this paper develops an innovative
control synthesis algorithm to make a general DC microgrid have a theoretically
guaranteed ROA, for example, to cover the entirety of its operating range
regarding state trajectories. We first study the nonlinear dynamics of a DC
microgrid to derive a novel transient stability condition to rigorously certify
whether a given operating range is a subset of the ROA; then, we formulate a
control synthesis optimization problem to guarantee the condition's
satisfaction. This condition is a linear constraint, and the optimization
problem resembles an optimal power flow problem and has a good computational
behavior. Simulation case studies verify the validity of the proposed work."

decision maker to formulate a preference regarding risks or trade-offs. If this
preference is known, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) criterion can be
applied to aggregate scenarios or objectives into a single function.
Formulating this preference, however, can be challenging, as we need to make
explicit what is usually only implicit knowledge. In this paper, we explore
methods of preference elicitation to identify the decision maker's weights that
define OWA. We assume that we have a set of examples available, where the
decision maker has chosen a preferred solution by hand. We then use these
examples to determine the underlying preference. We propose and compare two
approaches for this purpose. The first is an optimization-based model, where
weights are determined by solving an alternating sequence of linear programs
and standard OWA problems. The second is a machine learning model to predict
weights using a regression approach. Our numerical experiments indicate that
the performance of optimization-based models is improving with an increasing
size of given examples, which means that these models make effective use of the
given information; whereas the regression models can perform better when only
few examples are provided."

sequential two-player games, where the leader makes a binary here-and-now
decision, and the follower responds a continuous wait-and-see decision after
observing the leader's action and revelation of uncertainty. Only the
information of the mean, covariance, and support is known. We formulate the
problem as a distributionally robust (DR) two-stage problem. The pessimistic DR
bilevel program is shown to be equivalent to a generic two-stage
distributionally robust stochastic (nonlinear) program with both a random
objective and random constraints under proper conditions of ambiguity sets.
Under continuous distributions, using linear decision rule approaches, we
construct upper bounds on the pessimistic DR bilevel program based on (1) 0-1
semidefinite programming (SDP) approximation and (2) an exact 0-1 copositive
programming reformulations. When the ambiguity set is restricted to discrete
distributions, an exact 0-1 SDP reformulation is developed, and explicit
construction of the worst-case distribution is derived. To further improve the
computation of the proposed 0-1 SDPs, a cutting-plane framework is developed.

radii. The goal of the first player (pursuer) is to ensure that the second
player (evader) is guaranteed to be within a capture circle as quickly as
possible. The goal of the evader is to avoid the capture or delay it as long as
possible. The kinematics of both players are described by the same equations.
Thus, the game has only one free parameter, the capture radius. This work aims
at a fully analytical description of the barrier surface for all values of the
capture radius. Previously, A.W.~Merz analytically investigated the barrier of

determining where the optimal solution is eventually located, we implemented
improving procedures based on a local exchange, but applying different long

detect one or more communities embedded in a network. Even though its
definition is straightforward, e.g, the probability that a random walker
remains in a group of nodes, it has been seldom applied possibly for the
difficulty of developing an efficient algorithm to calculate it. Here, we
propose a new mathematical programming model to find the community with the
largest persistence probability. The model is integer fractional programming,
but it can be reduced to mixed-integer linear programming with an appropriate
variable substitution. Nevertheless, the problem can be solved in a reasonable
time for networks of small size only, therefore we developed some heuristic
procedures to approximate the optimal solution. First, we elaborated a
randomized greedy-ascent method, taking advantage of a peculiar data structure
to generate feasible solutions fast. After analyzing the greedy output and
determining where the optimal solution is eventually located, we implemented
improving procedures based on a local exchange, but applying different long
term diversification principles, that are based on variable neighborhood search
and random restart. Next, we applied the algorithms on simulated graphs that
reproduce accurately the clustering characteristics found in real networks to
determine the reliability and the effectiveness of our methodology. Finally, we
applied our method to two real networks, comparing our findings to what found
by two well-known alternative community detection procedures."

an analytical probability model in the formulation, we adopt a simulation
approach and pre-compute error terms for each option available to users for a
given number of scenarios. This results in a bilevel optimisation model that
is, however, intractable for all but the simplest instances. Using the
pre-computed error terms to calculate the users covered by each charging
station allows for a maximum covering model, for which solutions can be found
more efficiently than for the bilevel formulation. The maximum covering
formulation remains intractable in some instances, so we propose rolling
horizon, greedy, and GRASP heuristics to obtain good quality solutions more
efficiently. Extensive computational results are provided, which compare the
maximum covering formulation with the current state-of-the-art, both for exact

advanced algorithms such as decomposition based techniques. Even if a
decomposition technique might be appropriate, there are still many possible
decompositions for any large MIP and it may not be obvious which will be the
most effective. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the predictive
capabilities of a Machine Learning ranking (ML) function for predicting the
quality of Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) decompositions created via
constraint relaxation. In this analysis, the role of instance similarity and ML
prediction quality is explored, as well as the benchmarking of a ML ranking
function against existing heuristic functions. For this analysis, a new dataset
consisting of over 40000 unique decompositions sampled from across 24 instances
from the MIPLIB2017 library has been established. These decompostions have been
created by both a greedy relaxation algorithm as well as a population based
multi-objective algorithm, which has previously been shown to produce high
quality decompositions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a ML ranking
function is able to provide state-of-the-art predictions when benchmarked
against existing heuristic ranking functions. Additionally, we demonstrate that
by only considering a small set of features related to the relaxed constraints
in each decomposition, a ML ranking function is still able to be competitive
with heuristic techniques. Such a finding is promising for future constraint
relaxation approaches, as these features can be used to guide decomposition
creation. Finally, we highlight where a ML ranking function would be beneficial

the gradient of the objective function and the diffusion term is either bounded
or square-integrable. In this context, under Lipschitz continuity of the
gradient, our first main result shows almost sure convergence of the objective
and the trajectory process towards a minimizer of the objective function. We
also provide a comprehensive complexity analysis by establishing several new

inverse optimization model that inputs several accepted and rejected solutions
and recovers the underlying convex optimization model that correctly classifies
these given solutions. The novelty of our model is three-fold: First, while
most literature focuses on inferring the objective function only, we focus on
inferring the feasible region. Second, our model is capable of inferring the
constraints of general convex optimization models. Third, the proposed model
learns from both accepted (good) and rejected (bad) observations in inferring
the constraint set. The resulting model is a mixed-integer nonlinear problem,
and to mitigate its complexity, we use the theoretical properties of its
solutions to derive a reduced reformulation that is easier to solve. Using a

demonstrate that our proposed model can infer a set of clinical guidelines to

difference from other crew scheduling problems is that drivers can be exchanged
between buses en route. These exchanges may occur at arbitrary intermediate
stops such that our problem requires additional synchronization constraints. We
present a mathematical model for this problem that leverages a time-expanded
multi-digraph and derive bounds for the total number of required drivers.
Moreover, we develop a destructive-bound-enhanced matheuristic that converges
to provably optimal solutions and apply it to a real-world case study for
Flixbus, one of Europe's leading coach companies. We demonstrate that our
matheuristic outperforms a standalone MIP implementation in terms of solution
quality and computational time and improves current approaches used in practice
by up to 56%. Our solution approach provides feasible solutions for all
instances within seconds and solves instances with up to 390 locations and 70
requests optimally with an average computational time under 210 seconds. We
further study the impact of driver exchanges on personnel costs and show that
allowing for such exchanges leads to savings of up to 75%."

that include illiquid alternative asset classes. The main challenge in
portfolio construction with illiquid asset classes is that we do not have
direct control over our positions, as we do in liquid asset classes. Instead we
can only make commitments; the position builds up over time as capital calls
come in, and reduces over time as distributions occur, neither of which the
investor has direct control over. The effect on positions of our commitments is
subject to a delay, typically of a few years, and is also unknown or
stochastic. A further challenge is the requirement that we can meet the capital
calls, with very high probability, with our liquid assets.
  We formulate the illiquid dynamics as a random linear system, and propose a
convex optimization based model predictive control (MPC) policy for allocating
liquid assets and making new illiquid commitments in each period. Despite the
challenges of time delay and uncertainty, we show that this policy attains
performance surprisingly close to a fictional setting where we pretend the
illiquid asset classes are completely liquid, and we can arbitrarily and
immediately adjust our positions. In this paper we focus on the growth problem,
with no external liabilities or income, but the method is readily extended to
handle this case."

at our disposal, Benders decomposition with quadratic trust-region outperforms
closed optimization if planning covers more than six climatic years, because
run-time does not increase with the number of scenarios thanks to distributed
computing. Furthermore, results show that the quadratic trust-region approach
benefits from a heuristic starting solution but does not depend on it to be
performative.
  Finally, we suggest further improvements of the algorithm. First, heuristic
methods to narrow the solution space of the master-problem. Second,

phase synchronization/retrieval, power system state estimation, and robust PCA,
can be formulated as the matrix sensing problem. Two main approaches for
solving matrix sensing are based on semidefinite programming (SDP) and
Burer-Monteiro (B-M) factorization. The SDP method suffers from high
computational and space complexities, whereas the B-M method may return a
spurious solution due to the non-convexity of the problem. The existing
theoretical guarantees for the success of these methods have led to similar
conservative conditions, which may wrongly imply that these methods have
comparable performances. In this paper, we shed light on some major differences
between these two methods. First, we present a class of structured matrix
completion problems for which the B-M methods fail with an overwhelming
probability, while the SDP method works correctly. Second, we identify a class
of highly sparse matrix completion problems for which the B-M method works and
the SDP method fails. Third, we prove that although the B-M method exhibits the
same performance independent of the rank of the unknown solution, the success
of the SDP method is correlated to the rank of the solution and improves as the
rank increases. Unlike the existing literature that has mainly focused on those
instances of matrix sensing for which both SDP and B-M work, this paper offers
the first result on the unique merit of each method over the alternative
approach."

large-scale problems that seemed intractable decades ago are now a routine

At the same time, solving optimization problems often turns out to be one of
the smaller difficulties when putting solutions into practice. One major
barrier is that the optimization software can be perceived as a black box,
which may produce solutions of high quality, but can create completely
different solutions when circumstances change leading to low acceptance of
optimized solutions. Such issues of interpretability and explainability have
seen significant attention in other areas, such as machine learning, but less
so in optimization. In this paper we propose an optimization framework to
derive solutions that inherently come with an easily comprehensible explanatory
rule, under which circumstances which solution should be chosen. Focussing on
decision trees to represent explanatory rules, we propose integer programming
formulations as well as a heuristic method that ensure applicability of our
approach even for large-scale problems. Computational experiments using random

single scenario may determine the objective value of a given solution.
Accordingly, it is a challenging task to reduce the size of an uncertainty set

robust optimization problems with many scenarios tend to be hard to solve, in
particular for two-stage problems. Hence, a reduced uncertainty set may be
central to find solutions in reasonable time. We propose scenario reduction
methods that give guarantees on the performance of the resulting robust
solution. Scenario reduction problems for one- and two-stage robust
optimization are framed as optimization problems that only depend on the
uncertainty set and not on the underlying decision making problem. Experimental
results indicate that objective values for the reduced uncertainty sets are

problems. Such multi-stage problems are formulated with alternating min/max
quantifiers and therefore naturally fall into higher stage of the polynomial
hierarchy. Despite this, almost no hardness result with respect to the
polynomial hierarchy are known for robust multi-stage problems.
  In this work, we examine the hardness of robust two-stage adjustable and
robust recoverable optimization with budgeted uncertainty sets. Our main
technical contribution is the introduction of a technique tailored to prove
$\Sigma^p_3$-hardness of such problems. We highlight a difference between
continuous and discrete budgeted uncertainty: In the discrete case, indeed a
wide range of problems becomes complete for the third stage of the polynomial
hierarchy. We highlight the TSP, independent set, and vertex cover problems as
examples of this behavior. However, in the continuous case this does not happen
and all problems remain in the first stage of the hierarchy. Finally, if we
allow the uncertainty to not only affect the objective, but also multiple
constraints, then this distinction disappears and even in the continuous case
we encounter hardness for the third stage of the hierarchy. This shows that
even robust problems which are already NP-complete can still exhibit a
significant computational difference between column-wise and row-wise
uncertainty."

are dynamically maintained up to the day of executing the schedule. At each day
preceding the execution of the schedule, disruptions occur due to sudden
unavailability of personnel, making the planned regular and reserve-crew
schedules infeasible for its execution day. This paper studies the fundamental
question how to repair the schedules' infeasibility in the days preceding the
execution, taking into account labor regulations. We propose a robust repair
strategy that maintains flexibility in order to cope with additional future
disruptions. The flexibility in reserve-crew usage is explicitly considered
through evaluating the expected shortfall of the reserve-crew schedule based on
a Markov chain formulation. The core of our approach relies on iteratively
solving a set-covering formulation, which we call the Robust Crew Recovery
Problem, which encapsulates this flexibility notion for reserve crew usage. A
tailored branch-and-price algorithm is developed for solving the Robust Crew
Recovery Problem to optimality. The corresponding pricing problem is
efficiently solved by a newly developed pulse algorithm. Based on actual data
from a medium-sized hub-and-spoke airline, we show that embracing our approach
leads to fewer flight cancellations and fewer last-minute alterations, compared
to repairing disrupted schedules without considering our robust measure."

investigate the acceleration phenomenon. First, we provide a significantly
simplified proof based on precise observation and a tighter inequality for

version of phase-space representation and Lyapunov function, is proposed to
investigate the convergence behavior of the iterative sequence
$\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ of NAG. Furthermore, from two kinds of phase-space
representations, we find that the role played by gradient correction is
equivalent to that by velocity included implicitly in the gradient, where the
only difference comes from the iterative sequence $\{y_{k}\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$
replaced by $\{x_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$. Finally, for the open question of whether
the gradient norm minimization of NAG has a faster rate $o(1/k^3)$, we figure

Unfortunately, CVaR estimation involves considering observations with extreme

Indeed, parametric methods often underestimate the downside risk, which leads
to significant losses in extreme cases. The existing non-parametric methods, on

this paper, we propose an alternative non-parametric approach to CVaR
minimisation that uses only a small proportion of the data. Using both

disruptions happen. This process is usually divided into three sequential
decisions to recovery flights, aircraft, and cargoes. This study focuses on the
integrated recovery problem that makes aircraft and cargo recovery decisions
simultaneously. We formulate two integrated models based on the flight
connection network, one is the arc-based model, and the other is the
string-based model. The arc-based model makes the flight delay decisions by
duplicating flight copies, and is solved directly by commercial solvers such as
Cplex. The string-based model makes the flight delay decisions in the variable
generation process. The main difficulty of the string-based model is that the
number of constraints grows with the newly generated flight delay decisions.
Therefore, the traditional column generation method can not be applied
directly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning based
column-and-row generation approach. The machine learning method is used to
uncover the critical delay decisions of short through connections in each
column-and-row generation iteration by eliminating the poor flight delay
decisions. We also propose a set of valid inequality constraints which can
greatly improve the objective of LP relaxation solution and reduce the integral

simultaneously considering multiphase optimal power flow (MOPF) constraints to
accurately represent unbalanced low-voltage distribution networks. An algorithm
is developed to solve the resulting Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP)

Programming (MILP) and Nonlinear Programming (NLP), and utilises integer cuts
and complementarity reformulations to obtain discrete designs that are also
feasible with respect to the network constraints. A heuristic modification to
the original algorithm is also proposed to improve computational speed.
Improved formulations for selecting feasible combinations of air source heat
pumps (ASHPs) and hot water storage tanks are also presented. The algorithms
outperform the existing state-of-the-art commercial MINLP solver, which fails
to find any solutions in two instances. While feasible solutions were obtained
for all cases, convergence was not achieved for all, especially for those
involving the larger network. Where converged, the algorithm with the heuristic

Results for case studies suggest that including ASHPs can support up to 16%

higher ASHP investment costs. The optimisation framework and results can be
used to inform stakeholders such as policy-makers and network operators, to
increase renewable energy capacity and aid the decarbonisation of domestic

decision problems under uncertainty. Unfortunately, its application is made
difficult by two fundamental issues: the need to know the probability
distribution of the underlying risk factors and the explosion of the size of
the scenario tree in a multistage setting. In order to ease the latter issue,
we may shorten the planning horizon, but this can introduce end-of-horizon
effects, resulting in a myopic behavior. A possible remedy is to augment the
objective function with an additional term accounting for the value of the
terminal state. We do so in the context of a multistage production planning
problem within an assemble-to-order setting under demand uncertainty. In order
to test the idea in a difficult environment, we introduce seasonality,
bimodality, and correlations in the distribution of end items demand. We check
the effect of adding a piecewise linear approximation of the value of terminal
inventory of components to a two-stage model formulation by out-of-sample,
rolling horizon simulations. We compare different scenario tree structures,
built under limited information about the underlying distribution.
Computational experiments suggest the potential benefit of adding a terminal

the follower avoids the leader's jet wash region. This optimal control problem

descending spiral and continuous vertical loops. Additionally, a study of the
effect of various initial guesses is performed. All trajectories displayed a

derivative formula is also derived for providing more sensitivity information.
Then we develop a policy iteration type algorithm to efficiently optimize CVaR,
which is shown to converge to local optima in the mixed policy space. We
further discuss some extensions including the mean-CVaR optimization and the
maximization of CVaR. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments relating to
portfolio management to demonstrate the main results. Our work may shed light

particles along a 1D chain of sites. It has been extensively used to study
ribosome flow along the mRNA molecule during translation. When the transition
rates along the chain are time-varying and jointly T-periodic the RFM entrains,
i.e., every trajectory of the RFM converges to a unique T-periodic solution
that depends on the transition rates, but not on the initial condition.
Entrainment to periodic excitations like the 24h solar day or the 50Hz
frequency of the electric grid is important in numerous natural and artificial
systems. An interesting question, called the gain of entrainment (GOE), is
whether proper coordination of the periodic translation rates along the mRNA
can lead to a larger average protein production rate. Analyzing the GOE in the
RFM is non-trivial and partial results exist only for the RFM with dimensions
$n=1,2$. We use a new approach to derive several results on the GOE in the
general $n$-dimensional RFM. Perhaps surprisingly, we rigorously characterize
several cases where there is no GOE, so to maximize the average production rate

approaches to compensate for the delay. An obvious approach is to address this
problem in state space, where the $n$-dimensional plant state is augmented by
an $N$-dimensional (Pad\'e) approximation to the delay, affording (optimal)
state estimate feedback vis-\`a-vis the separation principle. Using this
framework, we show: (1) Feedback of the estimated plant states partially
inverts the delay; (2) The optimal (Kalman) estimator decomposes into $N$
(Pad\'e) uncontrollable states, and the remaining $n$ eigenvalues are the
solution to a reduced-order Kalman filter problem. Further, we show that the
tradeoff of estimation error (of the full state estimator) between plant
disturbance and measurement noise, only depends on the reduced-order Kalman
filter (that can be constructed independently of the delay); (3) A subtly
modified version of this state-estimation-based control scheme bears close

several limitations with its Smith predictor analog (including the inability to
stabilize most unstable plants), limitations that are alleviated when using the

programming that targets the same audience. A first difference compared to
other existing introductions to SDP is that this work comes out of a mind that
was itself struggling to understand. This may seem to be only a weakness, but,
paradoxically, it is both a weakness and a strength. First, I did not try to
overpower the reader, but I tried to minimize the distance between the author
and the reader as much as possible, even hoping to achieve a small level of
mutual empathy. This enabled me avoid a quite common pitfall: many
long-acknowledged experts tend to forget the difficulties of beginners. Other
experts try to make all proofs as short as possible and to dismiss as
unimportant certain key results they have seen thousands of time in their
career. I also avoided this, even if I did shorten a few proofs when I revised
this manuscript two years after it was first written. However, I also kept
certain proofs that seem longer than necessary because I feel they offer more
insight; an important goal is to capture the ""spirit"" of each proven result
instead of reducing it to a flow of formulae.
  The very first key step towards mastering SDP programming is to get full
insight into the eigen-decomposition of real symmetric matrices. It is enough
to see the way many other introductions to SDP programming address this
eigen-decomposition to understand that their target audience is different from
mine. They often list the eigen-decomposition without proof, while I give two

taking expected future patient arrivals into account. Different cancer centers
may have different scheduling objectives, and therefore each model is solved
using multiple different objective functions, including minimizing waiting
times, and maximizing the fulfillment of patients' preferences for treatment
times. The test data is generated from historical data from Iridium Netwerk, a
large cancer center in Belgium with 10 linear accelerators. The results
demonstrate that the CG-IP model can solve all the different problem instances

pre-computation, we develop two additional algorithms for solving the robust
Bellman update. Firstly, we present a cutting surface algorithm for solving
this linear program in a shorter time. This algorithm requires the same
pre-computation, but only ever solves the linear program over small subsets of
the ambiguity set. Secondly, we present a novel projection-based bisection
search algorithm that completely eliminates the need for discretisation and
does not require any pre-computation. We test our algorithms extensively on a
dynamic multi-period newsvendor problem under binomial and Poisson demands. In
addition, we compare our methods with the non-parametric phi-divergence based
methods from the literature. We show that our projection-based algorithm
completes robust value iteration significantly faster than our other two
parametric algorithms, and also faster than its non-parametric equivalent."

welfare. Unfortunately, park inequities are commonplace as historically
marginalized groups may have insufficient access. Platforms exist to identify
the geographical areas that would benefit from future park improvements.
However, these platforms do not include budget, infrastructure, and
environmental considerations that are relevant to park location decisions. To
support recreational and government agencies in addressing inequities in the
distribution and quality of parks, we propose a mixed-integer program that
minimizes insufficient access, defined as weighted deviations across multiple
categories. We consider an equity-focused min-max objective and an overall
objective to minimize total weighted deviations. We apply the model to a case

algorithms (ISTA) for solving the linear inverse problem with sparse
representation, which arises in signal and image processing. It is shown in the
numerical experiment to deblur an image that the convergence behavior in the
logarithmic-scale ordinate tends to be linear instead of logarithmic,
approximating to be flat. Making meticulous observations, we find that the
previous assumption for the smooth part to be convex weakens the least-square
model. Specifically, assuming the smooth part to be strongly convex is more
reasonable for the least-square model, even though the image matrix is probably
ill-conditioned. Furthermore, we improve the pivotal inequality tighter for
composite optimization with the smooth part to be strongly convex instead of
general convex, which is first found in [Li et al., 2022]. Based on this
pivotal inequality, we generalize the linear convergence to composite
optimization in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient
norm. Meanwhile, we set a simple ill-conditioned matrix which is easy to
compute the singular values instead of the original blur matrix. The new
numerical experiment shows the proximal generalization of Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent (NAG) for the strongly convex function has a
faster linear convergence rate than ISTA. Based on the tighter pivotal
inequality, we also generalize the faster linear convergence rate to composite
optimization, in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient
norm, by taking advantage of the well-constructed Lyapunov function with a
slight modification and the phase-space representation based on the
high-resolution differential equation framework from the implicit-velocity

Firstly we attack a nonlinear
interface problem on an unbounded domain with nonmonotone set-valued
transmission conditions. The investigated problem involves a nonlinear monotone
partial differential equation in the interior domain and the Laplacian in the
exterior domain. Such a scalar interface problem models nonmonotone frictional
contact of elastic infinite media. The variational formulation of the interface
problem leads to a hemivariational inequality (HVI), which however lives on the
unbounded domain, and thus cannot analyzed in a reflexive Banach space setting.
By boundary integral methods we obtain another HVI that is amenable to
functional analytic methods using standard Sobolev spaces on the interior
domain and Sobolev spaces of fractional order on the coupling boundary.
Secondly broadening the scope of the paper, we consider extended real-valued
HVIs augmented by convex extended real-valued functions. Under a smallness
hypothesis, we provide existence and uniqueness results, also establish a
stability result with respect to the extended real-valued function as
parameter. Thirdly based on the latter stability result, we prove the existence
of optimal controls for four kinds of optimal control problems: distributed
control on the bounded domain, boundary control, simultaneous
distributed-boundary control governed by the interface problem, as well as
control of the obstacle driven by a related bilateral obstacle interface
problem."

Descent Ascent} (GDA) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this
paper, we first study the convergence of a two-scale Mean-Field GDA dynamics
for finding the MNE of the entropy-regularized objective. More precisely we
show that for any fixed positive temperature (or regularization parameter), the
two-scale Mean-Field GDA with a {\em finite} scale ratio converges to
exponentially to the unique MNE without assuming the convexity or concavity of
the interaction potential. The key ingredient of our proof lies in the
construction of new Lyapunov functions that dissipate exponentially along the

dynamics. We show that with a temperature schedule that decays logarithmically
