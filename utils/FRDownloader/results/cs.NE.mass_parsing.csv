individuals of high aesthetic value. Yet traditional evolutionary computing
methods typically focus on optimisation, searching for the fittest individual
in a population. In this paper we apply quality-diversity search methods to
explore a creative generative system (an agent-based line drawing model). We
perform a random sampling of genotype space and use individual artist-assigned
evaluations of aesthetic quality to formulate a computable fitness measure
specific to the artist and this system. To compute diversity we use a
convolutional neural network to discriminate features that are dimensionally
reduced into two dimensions. We show that the quality-diversity search is able
to find multiple phenotypes of high aesthetic value. These phenotypes show
greater diversity and quality than those the artist was able to find using
manual search methods."

Three major components of MTEFIM are conducted via: 1) estimating the potential
relationship across transformations based on the degree of overlap across
individuals of different populations, 2) transferring individuals across
populations adaptively according to the inter-transformation relationship, and
3) selecting the final output seed set containing all the transformation's
knowledge. The effectiveness of MTEFIM is validated on both benchmarks and
real-world social networks. The experimental results show that MTEFIM can
efficiently utilize the potentially transferable knowledge across multiple
transformations to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several
popular IM-specific methods. The implementation of MTEFIM can be accessed at

of different relevant metrics such as the FT size, the error computed based on
the failure data set and the Minimal Cut Sets. Our results show that, for six
case studies from the literature, our approach successfully achieved automatic,

of its close relationship to the domains most promising from the viewpoint of
SNN application such as robotics. In the present paper, I describe an SNN

on modern neurochips. The SNN structure considered in the paper includes
spiking neurons described by a generalization of the LIFAT (leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron with adaptive threshold) model and a simple spike
timing dependent synaptic plasticity model (a generalization of
dopamine-modulated plasticity). My concept is based on very general assumptions
about RL task characteristics and has no visible limitations on its
applicability. To test it, I selected a simple but non-trivial task of training
the network to keep a chaotically moving light spot in the view field of an

TSP solver is responsible for designing the proper path and assisting the KP
solver in judging constraint violations. To address constraints, we propose a
dual-population coevolutionary algorithm (DPCA) as the KP solver, which
simultaneously maintains both feasible and infeasible populations. A dynamic
pointer network (DYPN) is introduced as the TSP solver, which takes city
locations as inputs and immediately outputs a permutation of nodes. The model,
which is trained by reinforcement learning, can capture both the structural and
dynamic patterns of the given problem. The model can generalize to other
instances with different scales and distributions. Experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm can outperform conventional approaches in terms of
training, inference, and generalization ability."

suffer from high latency (i.e., long simulation time steps), or cannot achieve
as high performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this paper, we
propose the Differentiation on Spike Representation (DSR) method, which could
achieve high performance that is competitive to ANNs yet with low latency.
First, we encode the spike trains into spike representation using (weighted)
firing rate coding. Based on the spike representation, we systematically derive
that the spiking dynamics with common neural models can be represented as some
sub-differentiable mapping. With this viewpoint, our proposed DSR method trains
SNNs through gradients of the mapping and avoids the common
non-differentiability problem in SNN training. Then we analyze the error when
representing the specific mapping with the forward computation of the SNN. To
reduce such error, we propose to train the spike threshold in each layer, and
to introduce a new hyperparameter for the neural models. With these components,
the DSR method can achieve state-of-the-art SNN performance with low latency on
both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet,

However,
machine learning methods often require a large amount of data in order to be
successful. This is especially troublesome in domains where collecting
real-world data is difficult and/or expensive. Data simulators do exist for
many of these domains, but they do not sufficiently reflect the real world data
due to factors such as a lack of real-world noise. Recently generative
adversarial networks (GANs) have been modified to refine simulated image data
into data that better fits the real world distribution, using the SimGAN
method. While evolutionary computing has been used for GAN evolution, there are
currently no frameworks that can evolve a SimGAN. In this paper we (1) extend
the SimGAN method to refine one-dimensional data, (2) modify Easy Cartesian
Genetic Programming (ezCGP), an evolutionary computing framework, to create
SimGANs that more accurately refine simulated data, and (3) create new
feature-based quantitative metrics to evaluate refined data. We also use our
framework to augment an electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset, a domain that suffers
from the issues previously mentioned. In particular, while healthy ECGs can be
simulated there are no current simulators of abnormal ECGs. We show that by
using an evolved SimGAN to refine simulated healthy ECG data to mimic

training a sparse random noise as a self-sustaining attractor in a feedback
spiking neural network. This way, we can generate many of what we shall call
prime attractors, and the networks that support them are like registers holding
a symbolic value, and we call them registers. Like symbols, prime attractors
are atomic and devoid of any internal structure. Moreover, the winner-take-all
mechanism naturally implemented by spiking neurons enables registers to recover
a prime attractor within a noisy signal. Using this faculty, when considering
two connected registers, an input one and an output one, it is possible to bind
in one shot using a Hebbian rule the attractor active on the output to the
attractor active on the input. Thus, whenever an attractor is active on the
input, it induces its bound attractor on the output; even though the signal
gets blurrier with more bindings, the winner-take-all filtering faculty can
recover the bound prime attractor. However, the capacity is still limited. It
is also possible to unbind in one shot, restoring the capacity taken by that
binding. This mechanism serves as a basis for working memory, turning prime
attractors into variables. Also, we use a random second-order network to
amalgamate the prime attractors held by two registers to bind the prime
attractor held by a third register to them in one shot, de facto implementing a
hash table. Furthermore, we introduce the register switch box composed of
registers to move the content of one register to another. Then, we use spiking
neurons to build a toy symbolic computer based on the above. The technics used
suggest ways to design extrapolating, reusable, sample-efficient deep learning
networks at the cost of structural priors."

cortical function and has achieved equal performance to BP on supervised
learning and auto-associative tasks. In contrast to BP, however, the
mathematical foundations of IL are not well-understood. Here, we develop a
novel theoretical framework for IL. Our main result is that IL closely
approximates an optimization method known as implicit stochastic gradient
descent (implicit SGD), which is distinct from the explicit SGD implemented by
BP. Our results further show how the standard implementation of IL can be
altered to better approximate implicit SGD. Our novel implementation
considerably improves the stability of IL across learning rates, which is
consistent with our theory, as a key property of implicit SGD is its stability.
We provide extensive simulation results that further support our theoretical

consolidating information as posited by the complementary learning systems

between SYNaptic consolidation and dual memory Experience Replay (SYNERgy). Our
method maintains a semantic memory that accumulates and consolidates
information across the tasks and interacts with the episodic memory for
effective replay. It further employs synaptic consolidation by tracking the
importance of parameters during the training trajectory and anchoring them to
the consolidated parameters in the semantic memory. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to employ dual memory experience replay in
conjunction with synaptic consolidation that is suitable for general CL whereby
the network does not utilize task boundaries or task labels during training or
inference. Our evaluation on various challenging CL scenarios and
characteristics analyses demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both
synaptic consolidation and CLS theory in enabling effective CL in DNNs."

has attracted attention due to the detection requirements for a large number of
targets. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model for the EDSSP
problem and an evolutionary algorithm framework based on reinforcement learning
(RL-EA). Numerous factors that affect electromagnetic detection are considered
in the model, such as detection mode, bandwidth, and other factors. The
evolutionary algorithm framework based on reinforcement learning uses the
Q-learning framework, and each individual in the population is regarded as an
agent. Based on the proposed framework, a Q-learning-based genetic
algorithm(QGA) is designed. Q-learning is used to guide the population search
process by choosing variation operators. In the algorithm, we design a reward
function to update the Q value. According to the problem characteristics, a new
combination of <state, action> is proposed. The QGA also uses an elite
individual retention strategy to improve search performance. After that, a task
time window selection algorithm is proposed To evaluate the performance of
population evolution. Various scales experiments are used to examine the
planning effect of the proposed algorithm. Through the experimental
verification of multiple instances, it can be seen that the QGA can solve the
EDSSP problem effectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the

optimization problems where the candidate solutions need to satisfy a
balancedness constraint. It has been observed that the reduction of the search
space size granted by ad-hoc crossover and mutation operators does not usually
translate to a substantial improvement of the GA performances. There is still
no clear explanation of this phenomenon, although it is suspected that a
balanced representation might yield a more irregular fitness landscape, where
it could be more difficult for GA to converge to a global optimum. In this
paper, we investigate this issue by adding a local search step to a GA with
balanced operators, and use it to evolve highly nonlinear balanced Boolean
functions. In particular, we organize our experiments around two research
questions, namely if local search (1) improves the convergence speed of GA, and
(2) decreases the population diversity. Surprisingly, while our results answer
affirmatively the first question, they also show that adding local search
actually \emph{increases} the diversity among the individuals in the
population. We link these findings to some recent results on fitness landscape
analysis for problems on Boolean functions."

efficiency and/or biological plausibility. Nevertheless, rigorous justification
for adopting LIF over other neuron models for use in artificial learning
systems has not yet been studied. This work considers various neuron models in
the literature and then selects computational neuron models that are
single-variable, efficient, and display different types of complexities. From
this selection, we make a comparative study of three simple I&F neuron models,
namely the LIF, the Quadratic I&F (QIF) and the Exponential I&F (EIF), to
understand whether the use of more complex models increases the performance of
the system and whether the choice of a neuron model can be directed by the task
to be completed. Neuron models are tested within an SNN trained with
Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) on a classification task on the
N-MNIST and DVS Gestures datasets. Experimental results reveal that more
complex neurons manifest the same ability as simpler ones to achieve high
levels of accuracy on a simple dataset (N-MNIST), albeit requiring comparably
more hyper-parameter tuning. However, when the data possess richer
Spatio-temporal features, the QIF and EIF neuron models steadily achieve better

limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease

more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft
winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm
that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error
signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport,
non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and
(self-) supervisory or other feedback signals -- which were necessary in other
approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade
off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather
improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier,
accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%,
80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically

different from the learning mechanism of the brain. In this paper, we develop a
biology-inspired learning rule that discovers features by local competitions
among neurons, following the idea of Hebb's famous proposal. It is demonstrated
that the unsupervised features learned by this local learning rule can serve as
a pre-training model to improve the performance of some supervised learning
tasks. More importantly, this local learning rule enables us to build a new
learning paradigm very different from the backpropagation, named activation
learning, where the output activation of the neural network roughly measures
how probable the input patterns are. The activation learning is capable of
learning plentiful local features from few shots of input patterns, and
demonstrates significantly better performances than the backpropagation
algorithm when the number of training samples is relatively small. This
learning paradigm unifies unsupervised learning, supervised learning and
generative models, and is also more secure against adversarial attack, paving a
road to some possibilities of creating general-task neural networks."

training neural policies to solve complex control tasks. However, these
policies tend to be overfit to the exact specifications of the task and
environment they were trained on, and thus do not perform well when conditions
deviate slightly or when composed hierarchically to solve even more complex
tasks. Recent work has shown that training a mixture of policies, as opposed to
a single one, that are driven to explore different regions of the state-action
space can address this shortcoming by generating a diverse set of behaviors,
referred to as skills, that can be collectively used to great effect in
adaptation tasks or for hierarchical planning. This is typically realized by
including a diversity term - often derived from information theory - in the
objective function optimized by RL. However these approaches often require
careful hyperparameter tuning to be effective. In this work, we demonstrate
that less widely-used neuroevolution methods, specifically Quality Diversity
(QD), are a competitive alternative to information-theory-augmented RL for
skill discovery. Through an extensive empirical evaluation comparing eight
state-of-the-art methods on the basis of (i) metrics directly evaluating the
skills' diversity, (ii) the skills' performance on adaptation tasks, and (iii)
the skills' performance when used as primitives for hierarchical planning; QD
methods are found to provide equal, and sometimes improved, performance whilst
being less sensitive to hyperparameters and more scalable. As no single method

a rich scope for further research which we support by proposing future
directions and providing optimized open-source implementations."

models. Recent progress in training methods has enabled successful deep SNNs on
large-scale tasks with low latency. Particularly, backpropagation through time
(BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) is popularly used to achieve high
performance in a very small number of time steps. However, it is at the cost of
large memory consumption for training, lack of theoretical clarity for
optimization, and inconsistency with the online property of biological learning
and rules on neuromorphic hardware. Other works connect spike representations
of SNNs with equivalent artificial neural network formulation and train SNNs by
gradients from equivalent mappings to ensure descent directions. But they fail
to achieve low latency and are also not online. In this work, we propose online
training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable
forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging
instantaneous loss and gradients. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze and prove
that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization
as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and
recurrent conditions. OTTT only requires constant training memory costs
agnostic to time steps, avoiding the significant memory costs of BPTT for GPU
training. Furthermore, the update rule of OTTT is in the form of three-factor
Hebbian learning, which could pave a path for online on-chip learning. With
OTTT, it is the first time that two mainstream supervised SNN training methods,
BPTT with SG and spike representation-based training, are connected, and
meanwhile in a biologically plausible form. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS demonstrate the superior performance of our method on
large-scale static and neuromorphic datasets in small time steps."

reasonable running time (mainly affected by the generation number, population
size, and evolution operator) given both the anticipated performance and
acceptable computation budget on ENAS problems. The expected hitting time
(EHT), which refers to the average generations, is considered to analyze the
running time of ENAS algorithms. This paper proposes a general framework for
estimating the EHT of ENAS algorithms, which includes common configuration,
search space partition, transition probability estimation, and hitting time
analysis. By exploiting the proposed framework, we consider the so-called
($\lambda$+$\lambda$)-ENAS algorithms with different mutation operators and
manage to estimate the lower bounds of the EHT {which are critical for the
algorithm to find the global optimum}. Furthermore, we study the theoretical
results on the NAS-Bench-101 architecture searching problem, and the results
show that the one-bit mutation with ""bit-based fair mutation"" strategy needs
less time than the ""offspring-based fair mutation"" strategy, and the bitwise
mutation operator needs less time than the $q$-bit mutation operator. To the

accelerate the design of printed circuit boards (PCB). In PCB design, while
automatic solvers have been developed to predict important indicators such as
the IR-drop, power integrity, and signal integrity, the generation of the power
plane itself still largely relies on laborious manual methods. Our automatic
power plane generation approach is based on genetic optimization combined with
a multilayer perceptron and is able to automatically generate power planes
across a diverse set of problems with varying levels of difficulty. Our method
GOMLP consists of an outer loop genetic optimizer (GO) and an inner loop
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that generate power planes automatically. The
critical elements of our approach include contour detection, feature expansion,
and a distance measure to enable island-minimizing complex power plane
generation. We compare our approach to a baseline solution based on A*. The A*
method consisting of a sequential island generation and merging process which
can produce less than ideal solutions. Our experimental results show that on
single layer power plane problems, our method outperforms A* in 71% of the
problems with varying levels of board layout difficulty. We further describe
H-GOMLP, which extends GOMLP to multilayer power plane problems using

                                        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been the go-to neural model for sequential tasks since the
                                        1980s and have been popular in recent years for a variety of applications, (see e.g., Karpathy, 2015),

on counting tasks over long sequences. Previous theoretical work has
established that RNNs with ReLU activation and LSTMs have the capacity for
counting with suitable configuration, while GRUs have limitations that prevent
correct counting over longer sequences. Despite this and some positive
empirical results for LSTMs on Dyck-1 languages, our experimental results show
that LSTMs fail to learn correct counting behavior for sequences that are
significantly longer than in the training data. ReLUs show much larger variance
in behavior and in most cases worse generalization. The long sequence
generalization is empirically related to validation loss, but reliable long
sequence generalization seems not practically achievable through
backpropagation with current techniques. We demonstrate different failure modes
for LSTMs, GRUs and ReLUs. In particular, we observe that the saturation of
activation functions in LSTMs and the correct weight setting for ReLUs to
generalize counting behavior are not achieved in standard training regimens. In
summary, learning generalizable counting behavior is still an open problem and
we discuss potential approaches for further research."

results show that the performance of the newly proposed EBCM (effective
butterfly optimizer with covariance matrix adaptation) algorithm performs
comparably to the 4 well performing variants of the established metaheuristics

exploration and exploitation trade-offs, in many aspects. The performance of
all 15 of the algorithms is likely to deteriorate due to certain
transformations, while the 4 state-of-the-art metaheuristics are less affected
