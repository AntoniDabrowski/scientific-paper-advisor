detectors. Infalling dark matter that scatters within stars could lead to a
range of observational signatures, including stellar heating, black hole
formation, and modified heat transport. To make robust predictions for such
phenomena, it is necessary to calculate the scattering rate for dark matter
inside the star. As we show in this paper, for small enough momentum transfers,
this requires taking into account collective effects within the dense stellar
medium. These effects have been neglected in many previous treatments; we
demonstrate how to incorporate them systematically, and show that they can
parametrically enhance or suppress dark matter scattering rates depending on
how dark matter couples to the Standard Model. We show that, as a result,
collective effects can significantly modify the potential discovery or
exclusion reach for observations of compact objects such as white dwarfs and
neutron stars. While the effects are more pronounced for dark matter coupling
through a light mediator, we show that even for dark matter coupling via a
heavy mediator, scattering rates can differ by orders of magnitude from their
naive values for dark matter masses <~ 100 MeV. We also illustrate how
collective effects can be important for dark matter scattering in more dilute
media, such as the Solar core. Our results demonstrate the need to
systematically incorporate collective effects in a wide range of astroparticle
contexts; to facilitate this, we provide expressions for in-medium
self-energies for a variety of different media, which are applicable to many
other processes of interest (such as particle production)."

elements, $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|$, based on the semileptonic decay $B_s^0\to
K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$. Its key component, the $B_s\to K$ transition form factor
$f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$, is studied within the QCD light-cone sum rules approach
by using a chiral correlator. The derived $f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$ is dominated by
the leading-twist part, and to improve its precision, we construct a new model
for the kaon leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;K}(x,\mu)$, whose
parameters are fixed by using the least squares method with the help of the
moments calculated by using the QCD sum rules within the background field
theory. The first four moments at the initial scale $\mu_0 = 1~{\rm GeV}$ are,
$\langle \xi^1\rangle _{2;K} = -0.0438^{+0.0053}_{-0.0075}$, $\langle
\xi^2\rangle _{2;K} = 0.262 \pm 0.010$, $\langle \xi^3\rangle _{2;K} =
-0.0210^{+0.0024}_{-0.0035}$ and $\langle \xi^4\rangle _{2;K} = 0.132 \pm
0.006$, respectively. And their corresponding Gegenbauer moments are,
$a^{2;K}_1 = -0.0731^{+0.0089}_{-0.0124}$, $a^{2;K}_2 =
0.182^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, $a^{2;K}_3 = -0.0114^{+0.0008}_{-0.0016}$ and
$a^{2;K}_4 = 0.041^{-0.003}_{+0.005}$, respectively. At the large recoil
region, we obtain $f^{B_s\to K} _+ (0) = 0.270^{+0.022}_{-0.030}$. By
extrapolating $f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$ to all the physical allowable region, we
obtain a $|V_{ub}|$-independent decay width for the semileptonic decay
$B_s^0\to K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $5.626^{+1.271}_{-0.864} \times 10^{-12}\ {\rm

$\Delta=2.5, 3, 3.5$ in the decoupling case of $\beta=0$. In the weak-coupling

background magnetic fields in the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.
Taking into account the anisotropic four-fermion interactions, a tensor current
arises in the magnetized QCD system, which forms an anomalous magnetic moment
(AMM) coupling in the Dirac equation for the quarks. By solving the gap
equations, we find that the sign of the dynamically generated AMM is opposite
to the sign of the quark's charge and its magnitude is definitely smaller than
the constituent mass. We construct two generalized Nambu-Goldstone pions, which
emerge as combinations of the quantum fluctuations around the conventional
scalar and the emergent tensor chiral condensates. We analytically demonstrate
that the Goldstone nature has been spoiled by the dimensional reduction in the
two-particle state and the corresponding decreasing mass of the lighter
generalized pionic mode is a remnant of the infrared dynamics."

isomers because of their the same spin-parity and quark content but different

the invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi$ pairs in 2020. This discovery inspires
us to further study the fully heavy pentaquark system. In this work, we
investigate systematically all possible configurations for ground fully heavy
pentaquark system via the variational method in the constituent quark model.
According to our calculations, we further analyze the relative lengths between
quarks and the contributions to the pentaquark masses from different terms of
the Hamiltonian. We think no stable states exist in fully heavy pentaquark
system. We hope that our study will be helpful to explore for fully heavy
pentaquark states."

potential evolves as we shift the gauge-fixing term. In this paper, relying on
an abelian toy model, we aim at proving this identity in a diagrammatic form
with the $\overline{R}_{\xi}$ gauge. The basic idea is to find out the ghost
chain after partially differentiating the diagram by the $\xi$ parameter, and
shrink the waists of the diagram into points to separate the bulk-part and
$C$-part of the diagrams. The calculations can be generalized to the models
implemented with non-abelian groups, multiple Higgs and fermion multiplets, and
to the finite temperature cases. Inspired by this, we also suggest that when
resumming the super-daisy diagrams, one can deduct some irrelevant terms at the
connections between the daisy ringlets to fit the Nielsen identity up to
arbitrary $\hbar$ orders."

already contribute at NNLO to the self-energy of the electron, $t \bar{t}$

couples to Standard Model (SM) fermions through interactions mediated by scalar

scenarios: dark matter annihilation mediated by first or second generation
scalar fermion partners with significant left-right chiral mixing and
co-annihilation with scalar fermion partners nearly degenerate in mass with the
dark matter. We then highlight the most interesting phenomenological aspects of
charged mediator models relevant for current and future searches for new
physics. We describe precision measurements of SM fermion dipole moments,
including models with scalar muon partners that can account for $g_\mu-2$. We
discuss new search strategies for charged mediators at the LHC and the
projected sensitivity of future lepton colliders. We summarize constraints from
direct detection and demonstrate how next generation experiments might probe
QCD-charged mediators at mass scales beyond the sensitivity of the LHC. We also
review the prospects for indirect detection of models with scalar lepton
partners, focusing on the sensitivity of gamma-ray searches to internal
bremsstrahlung emission."

the experimental and observational frontiers in particle physics, astronomy,
and cosmology. While there are no definitive signatures to date, there exists a
rich ecosystem of experiments searching for signals for a broad class of dark
matter models, at different epochs of cosmic history, and through a variety of
processes with different characteristic energy scales. Given the multitude of
candidates and search strategies, effective field theory has been an important
tool for parametrizing the possible interactions between dark matter and
Standard Model probes, for quantifying and improving model-independent
uncertainties, and for robust estimation of detection rates in the presence of
large perturbative corrections. This white paper summarizes a wide range of
effective field theory applications for connecting dark matter theories to

uncharted parts of the Standard Model; but it seems likely that new electroweak
physics may be out of reach of the present accelerator effort and the hope is
to observe small deviations from the SM. Given that, Effective Field Theory
becomes the logic method to use, and SMEFT has become the standard. However,
the most general theory with the known particle content is HEFT, and whether
SMEFT suffices should be investigated in future experimental efforts. Building
on investigations by other groups that established geometric criteria to
distinguish SMEFT from HEFT (useful for theorists examining specific beyond-SM
completions), we seek more phenomenological understanding and present an
analogous discussion aimed at a broader audience.

longitudinal electroweak gauge bosons $W_LW_L\to n\times h$ in the TeV region

$\mathcal{F}(h)$, that determines whether SMEFT or HEFT is needed. We also
present tree-level amplitudes including contact and exchange channels, as well
as a short discussion on accessing $\mathcal{F}(h)$ from the statistical limit
of many bosons. We also discuss the status of the coefficients of its series
expansion, its validity, whether its complex-$h$ extension can be used to
predict or not a tell-tale zero, and how they relate to the dimension-6 and -8
SMEFT operators in the electroweak sector. We derive a set of new correlations
among BSM corrections to the HEFT coefficients that help decide, from
experimental data, whether we have a viable SMEFT. This analysis can be useful

boson mass $M_W$ with a central value significantly larger than the SM

tension of this new measurement with the SM and explore potential beyond the SM
phenomena within the electroweak sector in terms of the oblique parameters $S$,
$T$ and $U$. We show that the large $M_W$ value can be accommodated in the fit
by a large, nonzero value of $U$, which is difficult to construct in explicit
models. Assuming $U = 0$, the electroweak fit strongly prefers large, positive
values of $T$. Finally, we study how the preferred values of the oblique
parameters may be generated in the context of models affecting the electroweak
sector at tree- and loop-level. In particular, we demonstrate that the
preferred values of $T$ and $S$ can be generated with a real SU(2)$_L$ triplet

neutrinoless double beta decay while the lighter one is lighter enough than the
typical Fermi-momentum scale of nuclei. They show that, under some specific
condition on the neutrino Yukawa couplings, the neutrinoless double beta decay
can be hidden. In this paper, we perform a further study of such an interesting
possibility in the complete seesaw model with three right-handed neutrinos. Our
framework is same as theirs except that there are two heavier right-handed
neutrinos so that the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe can be
explained via the leptogenesis mechanism. We first give the condition on the
neutrino Yukawa couplings for hiding the $0\nu \beta\beta$ decay, discuss its
realization by employing an Abelian flavor symmetry, and study its implications
for the mixing of the lighter right-handed neutrino with three left-handed

In summary, in this paper we have performed a further study of an interesting possibility proposed by
Asaka, Ishida and Tanaka that, in spite of the Majorana nature of neutrinos, the 0νββ decay can be
hidden.","Given that the
contribution of N3 to leptogenesis suﬀers the washout eﬀects of N2, the numerical results for this
scenario are similar to those for the former one, so we will not explicitly show them.","In the original AIT model, the AIT ansatz is realized in the minimal seesaw model with two
right-handed neutrinos which have a hierarchical mass structure: the lighter and heavier right-handed
neutrinos are respectively much lighter and heavier than Λβ.",2022-05-02 16:48:51+00:00,A split seesaw model with hidden neutrinoless double beta decay but successful leptogenesis,hep-ph,['hep-ph'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhen-hua Zhao')],"In a paper by Asaka, Ishida and Tanaka \cite{hiding}, they proposed a novel
possibility (which will be referred to as the AIT ansatz) that, in spite of the
Majorana nature of neutrinos, the neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu \beta\beta$)
decay can be hidden. In the original AIT model, the AIT ansatz is realized in
the minimal seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos which have a
hierarchical mass structure: the lighter and heavier right-handed neutrinos are
respectively much lighter and heavier than the typical Fermi-momentum scale of
nuclei. However, the original AIT model does not accommodate a successful
leptogenesis. For this problem, in this paper we study a split seesaw model
with one lighter right-handed neutrino but two heavier right-handed neutrinos
which can realize the AIT ansatz and accommodate a successful leptogenesis
simultaneously. We first give the condition on the neutrino Yukawa couplings
for realizing the AIT ansatz, discuss its realization by employing an Abelian
flavor symmetry, and study its implications for the mixing of the lighter
right-handed neutrino with three left-handed neutrinos. We then successively
study the implications for leptogenesis of the interesting scenarios where
$M^{}_{\rm D}$ is a triangular matrix (which has maximally-restricted texture
zeros, in line with the simplicity principle) or respects the $\mu$-$\tau$
reflection symmetry (which is well motivated by the experimental results), on
top of the AIT ansatz."

the New Horizon observations. The COB flux is $16.37\pm1.47\, \rm nW m^{-2}

4\sigma$ level above the expected flux from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
galaxy count. It would be great if this were a hint for the eV scale dark
matter decaying into photons. In this paper, we point out that such a decaying
dark matter model predicts a substantial amount of anisotropy in the COB flux,
which is accurately measured by the HST. The data of the HST excludes the decay
rate of the dominant cold dark matter larger than $10^{-24}$-$10^{-23}\,{\rm

anomaly to the long-standing discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of

two anomalies through a light pseudoscalar $A$. However, the model confronts
with the exotic Higgs decays of $h\to AA$ and the lepton flavor universality
data in the $\tau$ and $Z$ decays. To save the model, we propose that the light
pseudoscalar be Higgs-phobic, i.e., $\lambda_{hAA}=0$. Then type-X can explain
the two anomalies as well as all the other theoretical and experimental
constraints. Additional requirement of the cutoff scale above 10 TeV through
the RGE analysis severely limits the model, such that $\tan\beta\in[36,\,65]$,
$M_A \in [11,\,38]\,{\rm GeV}$, $M_{H^\pm} \in [283,\,338]\,{\rm GeV}$, and
$M_H \in[ 249,\,306]\,{\rm GeV}$. Due to sizable mass gaps between $M_A$ and
$M_{H,H^\pm}$ from the CDF $m_W$ measurement, dominant decay modes of $H$ and
$H^\pm$ are bosonic such as $H \to Z A$ and $H^\pm\to W^\pm A$. Since

inflation is imprinted into the cosmic microwave background. This energy flux
is characterized by correlation functions $\langle \mathcal{E}(\vec n_1)\cdots

There has been significant recent progress in studying energy flux, including
the calculation of multi-point correlation functions and their direct
measurement inside high-energy jets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this
paper, we build on these advances by defining a notion of ""celestial
non-gaussianity"" as a ratio of the three-point function to a product of
two-point functions. We show that this celestial non-gaussianity is under
perturbative control within jets at the LHC, allowing us to cleanly access the
non-gaussian interactions of quarks and gluons. We find good agreement between
perturbative calculations of the non-gaussianity and a charged-particle-based
analysis using CMS Open Data, and we observe a strong non-gaussianity peaked in
the ""flattened triangle"" regime. The ability to robustly study three-point
correlations is a significant step in advancing our understanding of jet
substructure at the LHC. We anticipate that the celestial non-gaussianity, and
its generalizations, will play an important role in the development of
higher-order parton showers simulations and in the hunt for ever more subtle
signals of potential new physics within jets."

infinity in the $n$-direction by means of gauge transformations. We show how
the obstruction appears in an explicit example of a perturbative calculation,

define the heavy quark and quarkonium transport coefficients, which are
seemingly equal in axial gauge, are actually different physical quantities of
the quark-gluon plasma and have different values. Furthermore, our findings

AMM plays the role of magnetic inhibition. It is found that a constant quark
AMM drives an unexpected 1st order chiral phase transition; a quark AMM
proportional to the chiral condensate gives a flip of the sign on the chiral
condensate; and a quark AMM proportional to the square of chiral condensate can
produce results of chiral condensate as functions of the temperature and the
magnetic field in good agreement with the lattice result."

In
addition to vacuum radiation, partons scatter on the medium constituents
resulting in induced emissions. Analytical approaches to including these
interactions have traditionally dealt separately with multiple, soft, or rare,
hard scatterings. A full description has so far only been available using
numerical methods. We achieve full analytical control of the relevant scales
and map out the dominant physical processes in the full phase space. To this
aim, we extend existing expansion schemes for the medium-induced spectrum to
the Bethe--Heitler regime. This covers the whole phase space from early to late
times, and from hard splittings to emissions below the thermal scale. Based on
the separation of scales, a space-time picture naturally emerges: at early
times, induced emissions start to build from rare scatterings with the medium.
At a later stage, induced emissions due to multiple soft scatterings result in
a turbulent cascade that rapidly degrades energy down to, and including, the
Bethe--Heitler regime. We quantify the impact of such an improved picture,
compared to the current state-of-the-art factorization that includes only soft
scatterings, by both analytical and numerical methods for the medium-induced
energy distribution function. Our work serves to improve our understanding of
jet quenching from small to large systems and for future upgrades of Monte
Carlo generators."

Curci-Ferrari model which, in turn, allows us to rely on perturbative
calculations. At one-loop order in the SU(2) case, the so-obtained longitudinal
gluon propagator provides a clear signature for Z2 center-symmetry breaking
with a singular behavior, characteristic of a continuous phase transition. This
is in sharp contrast with what is found within the standard Landau gauge. We
also identify various signatures for Z3 center-symmetry breaking in the SU(3)
case in the form of genuine order parameters. Among those, we find that the
gluon propagator, although degenerate along the diagonal color directions in
the confining phase, becomes non-degenerate in the deconfined phase. Our
results open new ways of identifying the transition from correlation functions

they can contribute to CP-odd observables.","One could also

symmetries, can only be approximate. This motivates us to quantify the breaking
of the shift invariance that characterizes the couplings of an axion-like
particle (ALP), and to identify proper order parameters associated to this
breaking. Focusing on the flavorful effective Yukawa couplings to Standard
Model fermions, we work out explicit conditions for them to maintain an exact
axion shift symmetry. Those conditions are given in terms of Jarlskog-like
flavor-invariants and can be directly evaluated from the values of the
different Yukawa couplings. Therefore, they represent order parameters for the
breaking of the axion shift symmetry. We illustrate this constrution by
matching the axion EFT to UV models, and by showing that the renormalization
group running closes on those shift-breaking flavor-invariants, as it should on
any complete set of order parameters. Furthermore, the study of the invariants'
CP-parities indicate that all but one are CP-odd, hence the assumption of CP
conservation suffices to cancel all but one sources of shift-breaking in the
theory. We also investigate similar conditions in the low-energy EFT below the
electroweak scale, and comment on relations inherited from a UV completion
which realizes the electroweak symmetry linearly. Finally, we discuss the order
parameter associated to the non-perturbative shift-breaking induced by the
axion-gluons coupling, which is also flavorful."

information about the spin of UV states: the sign of the IR Wilson coefficients

constructed for operators containing scalars and fermions, although we consider
the dimension-six SMEFT exhaustively, outlining why equivalent relations do not
hold for the remaining operators. As with any dimension-six dispersive
argument, our conclusions are contingent on the absence of potential poles at
infinity, so-called boundary terms, and we discuss in detail where these are

depends on only four parameters, the Yukawa coupling, the fermion mass, the
scalar mediator mass, and the DM density. At low fermion densities we delimit
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) and
crossover phases as a function of model parameters using the notion of
scattering length. We further study the BCS phase by consistently including
emergent effects such as the scalar density condensate and superfluid gaps.
Within the mean field approximation, we derive the consistent set of gap
equations, retaining their momentum dependence, and valid in both the
non-relativistic and relativistic regimes. We present numerical solutions to
the set of gap equations, in particular when the mediator mass is smaller and
larger than the DM mass. Finally, we discuss the equation of state (EoS) and
possible astrophysical implications for asymmetric DM."

4.A Fine-tuning Arguments

The large number of ﬂuxes or spurion ﬁelds can also help to alleviate the so called little
gauge hierarchy problem of MSSM in the light of heavy supersymmetric spectrum.",2022-07-19 15:57:43+00:00,Aspects of Heavy Supersymmetry,hep-ph,['hep-ph'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Priyanka Lamba')],"The discovery of the Higgs boson raises the question of its ""lightness"" in
mass when the Standard Model is considered as an effective quantum field
theory. Supersymmetry is the only currently known symmetry which can protect
the Higgs mass while still treating the Higgs as an elementary quantum field.
However in the view of null experimental confirmation from both direct (LHC)
and indirect searches (flavour, dark matter) of the supersymmetric particles
and the constraints from the Higgs mass, several possible heavy spectra for
supersymmetric partners have been proposed.
  In the present thesis, we study the possible origins of these heavy spectra
by considering a considering many sequestered spurion fields as carriers of
supersymmetry breaking. We show that ""natural"" supersymmetric spectrum is
possible in these models and in particular a ""coherent"" scenario leads to low
fine tuning, light Higgsino mixed dark matter ( a la focus point region) even
with heavy supersymmetric spectrum. We then consider this model within the
context of string landscape, where we use the Bousso-Polchinski framework of
four form fluxes to model the spurions. We show that the flavour violating
parameters of supersymmetric spectrum can be ""diluted"" away in the presence of
large number of fluxes.
  One of the possible supersymmetric spectra which emerges by considering all
the data is the generation split (Gensplit) spectrum which allows for flavour
violation to be present for the first two generations, which are heavy. We
study this spectrum within the context of supersymmetric SU(5) and proton
decay. The results are quite interesting and dependent on the proton decay mode
considered. The strongest bound p to k \nu is now modified depending on the
flavour of the neutrino and brings the parameter space within the realms of
upcoming experiments of JUNO, DUNE and Hyper K. These results will be
discussed."

knowledge, such conditions were not accessible during the early Universe
evolution and are not accessible now in the known astrophysical phenomena. To
achieve these new extreme conditions, we proposed performing high-luminosity
experiments at LHC or other colliders by means of scattering the two colliding
beams at the nuclei of a solid target that is fixed at their interaction
region. Under plausible assumptions, we estimate the reaction rate for the
p+C+p and Pb+Pb+Pb reactions and discuss the energy deposition into the target
and possible types of fixed targets for such reactions. To simulate the triple
nuclear collisions, we employed the well-known UrQMD 3.4 model for the beam
center-of-mass collision energies 2.76 TeV. As a result of our modeling, we
found that, in the most central and simultaneous triple nuclear collisions, the
initial baryonic charge density is approximately three times higher than the
one achieved in the ordinary binary nuclear collisions at this energy."

well-understood procedure. The inverse problem, the matching of the SMEFT to UV
scenarios, is more difficult and requires the development of new methods to
perform a systematic exploration of models. In this paper we use a diagrammatic
technique to construct in an automated way a complete set of possible UV models
(given certain, well specified assumptions) that can produce specific groups of
SMEFT operators, and illustrate its use by generating models with no tree-level
contributions to four-fermion (4F) operators. Those scenarios, which only
contribute to 4F at one-loop order, can contain relatively light particles that
could be discovered at the LHC in direct searches. For this class of models, we
find an interesting interplay between indirect SMEFT and direct searches. We
discuss some examples on how this interplay would look like when combining
low-energy observables with the SMEFT Higgs-fermion analyses and searches for
resonance at the LHC."

presence of gravity. We first explain, via arguments based on central charge
and species scale, that an EFT with a free continuum cannot consistently couple
to standard (i.e. 4D Einstein) gravity. It follows that EFTs with a free, or
nearly-free, continuum must either have a finite number of degrees of freedom
or nonstandard gravity. We demonstrate the latter through
holographically-defined continuum models, focusing on a class of 5D
dilaton-graviton systems giving rise to a gapped continuum (i.e. the linear
dilaton background). In the simplest version of the model we find an $R^{-2}$
deviation from the Newtonian potential. At finite temperature, we find an
energy density with $a^{-5}$ scaling law (i.e. $w=\frac{2}{3}$) in the brane

partonic energy loss mechanisms and the transport properties of the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) in high-energy nuclear collisions. In this work, we present the
first theoretical study of the longitudinal momentum fraction $z_{||}$ carried
by $\rm{D^0}$-meson in jets in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02
TeV. The p+p baseline is provided by POWHEG+PYTHIA8 which matches the
next-to-leading order hard processes with the parton shower. The in-medium
evolution of heavy quark jets is employed by a Monte Carlo transport model
which takes into account the collsional and radiative partonic energy loss in
the expanding QGP. We observe steeper $z_{||}$ distributions of $\rm{B^0}$-jet
compared to that of $\rm{D^0}$-jet at the same kinematics region in p+p
collisions, which may be a hint of the harder jet fragmentation function of
b-jet compared to c-jet in vacuum. In A+A collisions, it is shown that the jet
quenching effect would in general decrease the values of $z_{||}$. We have made
a systematical study on how several factors, including jet $p_{\rm{T}}$, jet
radius $R$ and collision centrality, would influence the medium modification of
$z_{||}$ distributions of $\rm{D^0}$-jet. In addition, we predict visibly
stronger nuclear modifications of $\rm{B^0}$-jet $z_{||}$ distributions

much steeper initial $z_{||}$ distribution of $\rm{B^0}$-jet in vacuum."

magnetic length $\sqrt{qB}$ which allows us to ignore the boundary effects at

it may be an extremely rapid rotation. Using the exact solution of the Dirac

the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}_{Z\to J/\psi J/\psi}$ still undershoots the

dimension of micron scale), which has recently been proposed as the unique
corner of the quantum gravity landscape consistent with both the Swampland
criteria and observations. In particular we show how this leads, by the
universal coupling of the Standard Model sector to bulk gravitons, to massive
spin 2 KK excitations of the graviton in the dark dimension (the ``dark
gravitons'') as an unavoidable dark matter candidate. Assuming a lifetime for
the current de Sitter phase of our universe of order Hubble, which follows from
both the dS Swampland Conjecture and TCC, we show that generic features of the
dark dimenson cosmology can naturally lead to the correct dark matter density
and a resolution of the cosmological coincidence problem, where the
matter/radiation equality temperature ($T\sim$ 1 eV) coincides with the
temperature where the dark energy begins to dominate. Thus one does not need to
appeal to Weinberg's anthropic argument to explain this coincidence. The dark
gravitons are produced at $T\sim$ 4 GeV, and their composition changes as they
mainly decay to lighter gravitons, without losing much total mass density. The
mass of dark gravitons is $m_{\text{DM}}\sim 1-100$ keV today."

dimension of micron scale), which has recently been proposed as the unique
corner of the quantum gravity landscape consistent with both the Swampland
criteria and observations. In particular we show how this leads, by the
universal coupling of the Standard Model sector to bulk gravitons, to massive
spin 2 KK excitations of the graviton in the dark dimension (the ""dark
gravitons"") as an unavoidable dark matter candidate. Assuming a lifetime for
the current de Sitter phase of our universe of order Hubble, which follows from
both the dS Swampland Conjecture and TCC, we show that generic features of the
dark dimenson cosmology can naturally lead to the correct dark matter density
and a resolution of the cosmological coincidence problem, where the
matter/radiation equality temperature ($T\sim$ 1 eV) coincides with the
temperature where the dark energy begins to dominate. Thus one does not need to
appeal to Weinberg's anthropic argument to explain this coincidence. The dark
gravitons are produced at $T\sim$ 4 GeV, and their composition changes as they
mainly decay to lighter gravitons, without losing much total mass density. The
mass of dark gravitons is $m_{\text{DM}}\sim 1-100$ keV today."

remaining oscillation parameters with very good precision. They will have
unprecedented capabilities to search for new physics that modify oscillations.
DUNE, with its broad band beam, good particle identification, and relatively
high energies will provide an excellent environment to search for new physics.
If deviations from the standard three-flavor oscillation picture are seen
however, it is crucial to know which new physics scenario is found so that it
can be verified elsewhere and theoretically understood. We investigate several
benchmark new physics scenarios by looking at existing long-baseline
accelerator neutrino data from NOvA and T2K and determine at what sensitivity
DUNE can differentiate among them. We consider sterile neutrinos and both
vector and scalar non-standard neutrino interactions, all with new complex
phases, the latter of which could conceivably provide absolute neutrino mass
scale information. We find that, in many interesting cases, DUNE will have good
model discrimination. We also perform a new fit to NOvA and T2K data with
scalar NSI."

transition. We will consider secluded dark sectors made of gauge theories,
Randall-Sundrum scenarios and conformally coupled elementary particles. These
sectors have in common the fact that the action is approximately Weyl
invariant, implying that particle production due to time dependent background
is strongly suppressed. In particular no significant production takes place
during inflation allowing to avoid strong isocurvature constraints from CMB. As
we will show, if the scale of inflation is large compared to the dynamical mass
scale, these sectors automatically undergo a phase transition that in the
simplest cases is controlled by the Hubble parameter. If the phase transition
takes place during reheating or radiation the abundance obtained can be larger
than particle production and production from the SM plasma. For phase
transitions completing during radiation domination, the DM mass is predicted in
the range $10^8$ GeV while larger values are required for phase transitions
occurring during reheating."

known as jet substructure, plays a central role in searches for new physics,

understanding of jets initiated by heavy quarks, whose description has lagged
behind remarkable recent progress for massless jets. In this Letter, we
initiate a study of correlation functions of energy flow operators on beauty

elementary particles of QCD. We present a factorization theorem incorporating
the mass of heavy quarks, and show that the heavy quark jet functions for
energy correlators have a simple structure in perturbation theory. Our results
achieve the very first full next-to-leading-logarithmic calculation of the
heavy quark jet substructure observable at the LHC. Using this framework, we
study the behavior of the correlators, and show that they exhibit a clear
transition from a massless scaling regime, at precisely the scale of the heavy
quark mass. This manifests the long-sought-after dead-cone effect and
illustrates fundamental effects from the intrinsic mass of beauty and charm
quarks in a perturbative regime, before they are confined inside hadrons. Our
theoretical framework for studying energy correlators using heavy jets has many

reported a new resonance $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ in the processes of $e^{+}e^{-}

Given the Born cross section similar with the previously reported
$\Upsilon(10753)$, the new resonance $\omega\chi_{bJ}$ may have be
$\Upsilon(10753)$. From the perspectives of traditional $\Upsilon(nS)$ meson
and exotic tetraquark $b\bar{q}q\bar{b}$ state with the $J^{PC}$ = $1^{--}$, we
tentatively investigate the $\Upsilon(10753)$ by solving Schr\""odinger equation
in the framework of the chiral quark model. Numerical results for the meson
show that the mass of $\Upsilon(5S)$ is up to 10.86 GeV and unsuitable for the
candidate of $\Upsilon(10753)$. On the other hand, not only the two kinds of
molecular structure ($b\bar{b}$-$q\bar{q}$, $b\bar{q}$-$q\bar{b}$) but also the
\da~structure ($\bar{b}\bar{q}$-$qb$) are considered into our tetraquark
calculation with the help of Gaussian expansion method. When a fully-channel
coupling is performed using the real-scaling method (stabilization method), we
get a stable resonance $^1R_{1}(10770)$ ( $^{2S+1}R_J$ ) with a great component
of the diquark-antidiquark state. Combined with the mass and width of
$^1R_{1}(10770)$, it may be a good candidate for experimental
$\Upsilon(10753)$. Besides, several resonance states ranging from 10.82 GeV to
10.96 GeV are obtained, which are expected to be further verified in future
experiments."

Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix $U$ exhibits a $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor
interchange symmetry $|U^{}_{\mu i}| = |U^{}_{\tau i}|$ (for $i = 1, 2, 3$) as
a good approximation. In particular, the T2K measurement implies that the
maximal neutrino mixing angle $\theta^{}_{23}$ and the CP-violating phase
$\delta$ should be close to $\pi/4$ and $-\pi/2$, respectively. Behind these
observations lies a minimal flavor symmetry -- - the effective Majorana
neutrino mass term keeps invariant under the transformations $\nu^{}_{e \rm L}
\to (\nu^{}_{e \rm L})^c$, $\nu^{}_{\mu \rm L} \to (\nu^{}_{\tau \rm L})^c$ and
$\nu^{}_{\tau \rm L} \to (\nu^{}_{\mu \rm L})^c$. Extending this flavor
symmetry to the canonical seesaw mechanism, we find that the $R$-matrix
describing the strength of weak charged-current interactions of heavy Majorana
neutrinos satisfies $|R^{}_{\mu i}| = |R^{}_{\tau i}|$ as a consequence of
$|U^{}_{\mu i}| = |U^{}_{\tau i}|$. This result can be used to set a new upper

that, contrary to the widely-held claim {over the past few tens of years}, the

distribution is largely biased toward one of the minima. This is due to the
fact that the domain wall network retains information about initial conditions
on superhorizon scales, and that the scaling solution is not a local attractor
in this sense. Our finding immediately implies that such domain walls will have
a significant impact on cosmology, including the production of gravitational

a small splitting determined by the Majorana mass. This will affect the
neutrino oscillation pattern for long baselines. We revisit this scenario
employing recent solar neutrino data, including the seasonal variation of the

avoids the tree-level inelastic scattering through Z-boson exchange. These
effective operators give rise to sizable contributions from Higgs mediated dark
matter interactions with quarks and gluons. A linear combination of the
effective couplings named $\lambda$ is identified as the critical parameter in
determining the magnitude of the cross-section. When $\lambda$ is smaller than
the critical value, the theory behaves similar to the known renormalisable
model, and the scattering rate stays below the current experimental reach.
Nevertheless, above the criticality, the contribution from the higher
dimensional operators significantly changes the phenomenology. The scattering
amplitude of pseudo-real models will be coherently enhanced, so that it would
be possible for next generation large-exposure experiments to fully probe these

the resulting stochastic gravitational waves (GW) can be detected at future

we focus on the region of parameter space of the type-II seesaw part of this

masses from their canonical searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
However, it is found that the LHC precision study of the Standard Model (SM)
Higgs decay in the di-photon channel has already excluded most of this region
of parameter space of FOEWPT caused by the alteration of the shape of the SM
Higgs potential as a consequence of large interactions with the triplet sector.
On the other hand, the latest spin-independent DM direct detection constraints
from XENON-1T and PANDA-4T eliminate a significant amount of parameter space
that changes the SM Higgs potential in favor of a FOEWPT mostly from the dark
sector and it is only possible for significantly underabundant DM scenarios. We

the Universe is populated by large inhomogeneities on very small scales.
Eventually, these fluctuations will collapse gravitationally to form dense
axion miniclusters that trap up to $\sim$75% of the dark matter within
asteroid-mass clumps. Axion miniclusters are physically tiny however, so
haloscope experiments searching for axions directly on Earth are much more
likely to be probing ``minivoids'' -- the space in between miniclusters. This
scenario seems like it ought to spell doom for haloscopes, but while these
minivoids might be underdense, they are not totally devoid of axions. Using
Schr\""odinger-Poisson and N-body simulations to evolve from realistic initial
field configurations, we quantify the extent to which the local ambient dark
matter density is suppressed in the post-inflationary scenario. We find that a
typical experimental measurement will sample an axion density that is only
around 10% of the expected galactic dark matter density. Our results also have
implications for experimental campaigns lasting longer than a few years, as
well as broadband haloscopes that have sensitivity to transient signatures. We
show that for a $\mathcal{O}$(year)-long integration times, the measured dark
matter density should be expected to vary by 20--30%."

Kilometer Array (SKA) radio telescope. We show that for axions lighter than a
few $\times$ $10^{-13}$ eV a 100\,h SKA observation of the local dwarf galaxy
Seg I would probe parameter space not constrained by stellar cooling and
cosmological observations, with sensitivity several orders of magnitude better
than the planned dedicated axion dark matter search experiments. We quantify
the uncertainties in the SKA sensitivity projections due to two effects that
enhance the photon flux: the presence of turbulent magnetic fields inside the
galaxy, and the Bose enhancement of the DM decays to axions, where the latter,
in particular, warrants further study."

attention is devoted to wave propagation.","A ﬁnal appendix section 5 is included, where subsections

Ángeles Pérez-García'), arxiv.Result.Author('A. Pérez Martínez'), arxiv.Result.Author('E. Rodríguez Querts')]","Using the quadratic expansion in the photon fields of Euler-Heisemberg (EH)
non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) Lagrangian model we study relevant vacuum
properties in a scenario involving the propagation of a photon probe in the
presence of a background constant and static magnetic field, $B_e$. We compute
the gauge invariant, symmetric and conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) and
the angular momentum tensor (AMT) for arbitrary magnetic field strength using
the Hilbert method under the soft-photon approximation. We discuss how the
presence of magneto-electric terms in the EH Lagrangian is a source of
anisotropy and induce the non-zero trace in the EMT, the latter being connected
to the non-conformal anomaly of the non-linear Lagrangian and with the
non-conservation of the light cone in Minkowski space-time inducing
birefringence. From the EMT we analyze some quantities of interest such as the
energy density, pressures, Poynting vector, and angular momentum vector and we
compare them with those obtained from the Noether method. The magnetized vacuum
properties are also studied showing that a photon-effective magnetic moment can
be defined for different polarization modes. The calculations are done in terms
of derivatives of the two scalar invariants of electrodynamics hence, extension
to other NLED Lagrangian is straightforward. We discuss further physical
implications and experimental strategies to test magnetization, photon pressure
and efective magnetic moment."

adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector
representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of
critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors,
${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter
$r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that
critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like
coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined
co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf
b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal
intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena
emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference
of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these
new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the
vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other.
Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable

methods compare data with a potential signal against a template of the Standard
Model (SM) background inferred from sideband regions. We propose a means to
generate this background template that uses a flow-based model to create a
mapping between high-fidelity SM simulations and the data. The flow is trained
in sideband regions with the signal region blinded, and the flow is conditioned
on the resonant feature (mass) such that it can be interpolated into the signal
region. To illustrate this approach, we use simulated collisions from the Large

background method has competitive sensitivity with other recent proposals and

significance of 2.6$\sim$3.1 $\sigma$. Besides, an $b\bar{b}$ excess at 98 GeV

years ago. In this work, we consider interpreting these excesses together with
a light Higgs boson in the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model

the 95$\sim$100 GeV excesses both well in NMSSM, and with the latter satisfied
at 2$\sigma$ level, the former can be about $42\%$ at most. An approximate
equation of global fit to the three excesses is derived, and two representative
types of surviving samples are analyzed in detail. Since the mass regions of
these excesses are near the Z boson, we also consider checking the light Higgs
boson in the $t\bar{t}$-associated channels. The detailed results may be useful

has so far remained elusive in laboratory searches for new particles. Searches
at current and future colliders are in principle a promising way to search for
electroweak charged dark matter particles, but the sensitivity of experiments
at the LHC and future $pp$ colliders falls short to fully probe the whole mass
range allowed for electroweak charged dark matter particles, which extends in
principle up to the O(0.1) PeV. In this work we examine the effect of on-shell
and off-shell propagation of electroweak charged thermal dark matter particles
on integrated and differential rates of several Standard Model final states at
the muon collider, considering candidates from weak 2-plet at the TeV scale up
to 7-plet and 9-plet in the O(0.1) PeV ballpark. For fermionic WIMPs we find
that all dark matter candidates with $n\leq 5$, corresponding to a thermal mass
up to 14~TeV, can be excluded at the high-energy muon collider for some
center-of-mass energy at or below 14~TeV. For the $n>5$ WIMPs our results show
that higher energy muon colliders offer a route to conclusively probe both
scalar and fermionic WIMPs off-shell production all the way up to the
perturbativity bound for WIMP dark matter at O(0.1)~PeV. Our results bring
WIMPs over the whole allowed mass range in the realm of collider searches and
motivate research and development for the realization of a high energy muon

original tree level bounds are modified by loop corrections, which involve low
dimensional coefficients. New positivity bounds being valid at one loop level
on the four-Higgs scattering have been provided. We study some specific
ultraviolet models to check the validity of the new bounds. In addition, the
renormalisation group effect on positivity is explored. We point out that as
long as the new bounds are satisfied at the cutoff scale $\Lambda$, they will
also be satisfied at all scales."

quantum number of the intermediate $P$-wave diquark state $\langle
