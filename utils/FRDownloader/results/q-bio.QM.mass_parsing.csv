from organismic development to tumor progression.In oncology,these microRNAs
constitute a fundamental regulation role in the pathology of cancer that
provides the basis for probing into the influences on clinical features through
transcriptome data. Previous work focused on machine learning (ML) for
searching biomarkers in different cancer databases, but the functions of these
biomarkers are fully not clear. Taking lung cancer as a prototype case of
study. Through integrating clinical information into the transcripts expression
data, we systematically analyzed the effect of microRNA on diagnostic and
prognostic factors at deteriorative lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). After dimension
reduction, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to find the diagnostic
factors which represent the unique expression patterns of microRNA at various
patient's stages. In addition, we developed a classification framework, Light
Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and SHAPley Additive explanation (SHAP)
algorithm, to screen out the prognostic factors. Enrichment analyses show that
the diagnostic and prognostic factors are not only enriched in cancer-related
athways, but also involved in many vital cellular signaling transduction and
immune responses. These key microRNAs also impact the survival risk of LUAD
patients at all (or a specific) stage(s) and some of them target some important
Transcription Factors (TF).The key finding is that five microRNAs
(hsa-mir-196b, hsa-mir-31, hsa-mir-891a, hsa-mir-34c, and hsa-mir-653) can then
serve as not only potential diagnostic factors but also prognostic tools in the
monitoring of lung cancer."

sequence to obtain novel functionalities. In this method, amino acids in the
sequence are permutated to find the low energy states satisfying the
configuration. However, exploring all possible combinations of amino acids is
generally impossible to achieve on conventional computers due to the
exponential growth of possibilities with the number of designable sites. Thus,
sampling methods are currently used as a conventional approach to address the
protein design problems. Recently, quantum computation methods have shown the
potential to solve similar types of problems. In the present work, we use the
general idea of Grover's algorithm, a pure quantum computation method, to
design circuits at the gate-based level and address the protein design problem.
In our quantum algorithms, we use custom pair-wise energy tables consisting of
eight different amino acids. Also, the distance reciprocals between designable
sites are included in calculating energies in the circuits. Due to the noisy
state of current quantum computers, we mainly use quantum computer simulators
for this study. However, a very simple version of our circuits is implemented
on real quantum devices to examine their capabilities to run these algorithms.
Our results show that using $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt N)$ iterations, the circuits
find the correct results among all $N$ possibilities, providing the expected
quadratic speed up of Grover's algorithm over classical methods."

of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology to comprehensively uncover functional and
signaling pathways of drug treatment using bioinformatics inference and
multiscale modeling of both scRNA-seq data and proteomics data. The innovative
and cross-disciplinary approach can be further applied to other computational
studies in tumorigenesis and oncotherapy. Results: A time series of lung
adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells after DEX treatment were analysed. (1) We
first discovered the differentially expressed genes in those lung cancer cells.
Then through the interrogation of their regulatory network, we identified key
hub genes including TGF-\b{eta}, MYC, and SMAD3 varied underlie DEX treatment.
Further enrichment analysis revealed the TGF-\b{eta} signaling pathway as the
top enriched term. Those genes involved in the TGF-\b{eta} pathway and their
crosstalk with the ERBB pathway presented a strong survival prognosis in
clinical lung cancer samples. (2) Based on biological validation and further
curation, a multiscale model of tumor regulation centered on both
TGF-\b{eta}-induced and ERBB-amplified signaling pathways was developed to
characterize the dynamics effects of DEX therapy on lung cancer cells. Our
simulation results were well matched to available data of SMAD2, FOXO3,
TGF\b{eta}1, and TGF\b{eta}R1 over the time course. Moreover, we provided
predictions of different doses to illustrate the trend and therapeutic

Peng'), arxiv.Result.Author('Kelvin C. Fong'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michelle L. Bell')]","Mortality displacement is the concept that deaths are moved forward in time
(e.g., a few days, several months, and years) by exposure from when they would
occur without the exposure, which is common in environmental time-series
studies. Using concepts of a frail population and loss of life expectancy, it
is understood that mortality displacement may decrease rate ratio (RR). Such
decreases are thought to be minimal or substantial depending on study
populations. Environmental epidemiologists have interpreted RR considering
mortality displacement. This theoretical paper reveals that mortality
displacement can be formulated as a built-in selection bias of RR in Cox models
due to unmeasured risk factors independent from exposure of interest, and
mortality displacement can also be viewed as an effect modifier by integrating
the concepts of rate and loss of life expectancy. Thus, depending on the
framework through which we view bias, mortality displacement can be categorized
as selection bias in the bias taxonomy of epidemiology, and simultaneously
mortality displacement can be seen as an effect modifier. This dichotomy
provides useful implications regarding policy, effect modification, exposure
time-windows selection, and generalizability, specifically why research in
epidemiology may produce unexpected and heterogeneous RR over different studies

generating a shockwave. To generate a shock wave that is properly scaled from
human to rodent subjects the shock wave must have a short duration and high
peak overpressure while fitting a Friedlander waveform, the ideal
representation of a blast wave. A large variety of factors have been
experimentally characterized in attempts to create an ideal waveform, however
we found current research on the gas composition being used to drive shock wave
formation to be lacking. To better understand the effect the driver gas has on
the waveform being produced, we utilized a previously established murine shock
tube bTBI model in conjunction with several distinct driver gasses. In
agreement with previous findings, helium produced a shock wave most closely
fitting the Friedlander waveform in contrast to the plateau-like waveforms
produced by some other gases. The peak pressure at the exit of the shock tube
and 5 cm from the exit have a strong negative correlation with the density of
the gas being used: helium the least dense gas used produces the highest peak
overpressure. Density of the driver gas also exerts a strong positive effect on
the duration of the shock wave, with helium producing the shortest duration
wave. Due to its ability to produce a Friedlander waveform and produce a
waveform following proper injury scaling guidelines, helium is an ideal gas for
use in shock tube models for bTBI."

  2. Here we describe a novel modeling approach designed to estimate species
population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in
citizen science data. The approach is based on Double Machine Learning, a
statistical framework that uses machine learning methods to estimate population
change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding discovered in
the data. Additionally, we develop a simulation method to identify and adjust
for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores. Using this new
method, we can produce spatially detailed trend estimates from citizen science
data.
  3. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from
the CS project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the
method to estimate spatially varying trends in the face of real-world
confounding. Results showed that the trend estimates distinguished between
spatially constant and spatially varying trends at a 27km resolution. There
were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change
(increasing/decreasing) and high correlations on the estimated magnitude.
  4. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for
confounding in citizen science data has the potential to fill important
information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species, regions,
or seasons without rigorous monitoring data."

Anderson'), arxiv.Result.Author('Henry van den Bedem')]","Virtual, make-on-demand chemical libraries have transformed early-stage drug
discovery by unlocking vast, synthetically accessible regions of chemical
space. Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in these libraries from
millions to trillions of compounds, hiding undiscovered, potent hits for a
variety of therapeutic targets. However, they are quickly approaching a size
beyond that which permits explicit enumeration, presenting new challenges for
virtual screening. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Combinatorial
Synthesis Library Variational Auto-Encoder (CSLVAE). The proposed generative
model represents such libraries as a differentiable, hierarchically-organized
database. Given a compound from the library, the molecular encoder constructs a
query for retrieval, which is utilized by the molecular decoder to reconstruct
the compound by first decoding its chemical reaction and subsequently decoding
its reactants. Our design minimizes autoregression in the decoder, facilitating
the generation of large, valid molecular graphs. Our method performs fast and
parallel batch inference for ultra-large synthesis libraries, enabling a number
of important applications in early-stage drug discovery. Compounds proposed by
our method are guaranteed to be in the library, and thus synthetically and
cost-effectively accessible. Importantly, CSLVAE can encode out-of-library
compounds and search for in-library analogues. In experiments, we demonstrate
the capabilities of the proposed method in the navigation of massive
combinatorial synthesis libraries."

Four cultivars were used: MAVKA, MERLIN, VIOLETTA, and ANUSZKA. Moreover, the
advanced Machine Learning processing pipeline was proposed to distinguish the
impact of physical factors on photosynthetic parameters. It is possible to
distinguish exposition on different physical factors for the first three
cultivars; therefore, it indicates that the EM factors have some observable
effect on soy plants. Moreover, some influence of physical factors on growth
parameters was observed. The use of ELM (Electromagnetic) fields had a positive
impact on the germination rate in Merlin plants. The highest values were
recorded for the constant magnetic field (CMF) - Merlin, and the lowest for the
alternating electric field (AEF) - Violetta. An increase in terms of emergence

cultivar, except for the AEF treatment (number of plants after 30 days) (...)"
