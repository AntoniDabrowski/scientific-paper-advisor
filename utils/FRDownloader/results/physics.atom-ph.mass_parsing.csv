opportunities to optimize performance for quantum sensing and explore emerging
phenomena of many-body systems. An optical lattice clock based on partially
delocalized Wannier-Stark states in a gravity-tilted shallow lattice supports
superior quantum coherence and adjustable interactions via spin-orbit coupling,
thus presenting a powerful spin model realization. The relative strength of the
on-site and off-site interactions can be tuned to achieve a zero density shift
at a `magic' lattice depth. This mechanism, together with a large number of
atoms, enables the demonstration of the most stable atomic clock while
minimizing a key systematic uncertainty related to atomic density. Interactions
can also be maximized by driving off-site Wannier-Stark transitions, realizing
a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic dynamical phase transition."
