state \omega for ghost energy density in an FRW universe in complex
quintessence theory. We reconstruct the potential and study the dynamics of the
scalar field that describes complex quintessence cosmology. We perform
\omega-\omega' analysis and stability analysis for both non-interacting and
interacting cases and find that the same basic conclusion as for the real
model, where \omega' = d\omega/dlna. Taking account of the effect of the
complex part and assuming the real part of the quintessence field to be a
""slow-rolling"" field, we conclude that the non-interacting model cannot
describe the real universe since this will lead to fractional energy density
\Omega_D > 1, where \Omega_D can be defined as the ratio of \rho_D to
\rho_{cr}. However, for the interacting case, if we take present \Omega_D =
0.73, then we can determine that b^2 = 0.0849, where b^2 is the interaction
coupling parameter between matter and dark energy. In the real quintessence
model, \Omega_D and b^2 are independent parameters, whereas in the complex
quintessence model, we conclude that there is a relationship between these two
parameters."

the horizons of black holes. However, Giddings proposed that the Hawking
radiation spectrum that characterizes evaporating semi-classical black holes
originates from a quantum atmosphere, which extends beyond the horizon of a
black hole. Although several research projects have been conducted in this
field, they have not yet taken into account the effect of R\'enyi entropy. In
the present article, we will therefore consider the effect of R\'enyi entropy
on Hawking radiation power. We assume that if the effect of R\'enyi entropy is
very small, we suggest that the Hawking radiation should originate from the
quantum atmosphere which extends beyond the black hole's horizon for finite
dimensions. That is, that Giddings' suggestion is the more likely of the above
possibilities. However, for infinite dimensions, both suggestions are equally
credible. We briefly consider the very large effect of R\'enyi entropy on
Hawking radiation power as well. We find that if the effect of R\'enyi entropy
is very large and {\omega}/T_{BH} is very small, then the power spectral
density S_R is proportional to the power spectral density S_{BH}."

gravity and its emergence in random matrix models requires fully embracing {\it
both} Wigner (statistics) and 't Hooft (geometry). Using non-perturbative
definitions of random matrix models that yield various JT gravity and JT
supergravity models on Euclidean surfaces of arbitrary topology, Fredholm
determinants are used to extract precise information about the spectra of
discrete microstates that underlie the physics. A core result of the
computations is that in each case, the (super) Schwarzian spectrum seen at
leading order is only an approximation to a new kind of spectrum that is
fundamentally discrete. It is further argued that the matrix models point to a
{\it single} distinguished copy of the discrete spectrum that characterizes the
holographic dual of the Lorentzian (super) gravity theory. These facts suggest
that the factorization puzzle is entirely resolved since the discrete spectrum
underlying the Schwarzian can have a sensible quantum mechanical origin in a
single theory, without an appeal to an ensemble. It is argued that more
generally, double-scaled matrix models contain information about both the
Lorentzian and Euclidean approaches to quantum gravity. The former comes from
the Wignerian approach while the latter from the 't Hooftian 1/N topological
expansion."

To warm
up, we start with Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We derive the one point function of
stress tensor and show that the central charge related to the norm of
displacement operator is positive for the couplings obeying causality
constraints. Furthermore, by imposing the null energy condition on the
end-of-the-world brane, we prove the holographic g-theorem for Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. This corrects a wrong point of view in the literature, which claims
that the holographic g-theorem is violated for Gauss-Bonnet gravity. As a
by-product, we obtain the boundary entropy and A-type boundary central charges
in general dimensions. We also study AdS/BCFT for general curvature-squared
gravity. We find that it is too restrictive for the shape of the brane and the
dual BCFT is trivial if one imposes Neumann boundary conditions for all of the
gravitational modes. Instead, we propose to impose Dirichlet boundary condition
for the massive graviton, while imposing Neumann boundary condition for the
massless graviton. In this way, we obtain non-trivial shape dependence of
stress tensor and well-defined central charges. In particular, the holographic
g-theorem is satisfied by general curvature-squared gravity. Finally, we
discuss the island and show that the Page curve can be recovered for
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Interestingly, there are zeroth-order phase transitions
for the Page curve within one range of couplings obeying causality constraints.
Generalizing the discussions to holographic entanglement entropy and
holographic complexity in AdS/CFT, we get new constraints for the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling, which is stronger than the causality constraint."

the occurrence of superpositions of physical states in such a way that, when
combined with general relativity, space and time themselves may require new

considered as two-dimensional conformal correlators of a putative
two-dimensional celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). The simplest way of
converting momentum space amplitudes into CCFT correlators is by taking their
Mellin transforms with respect to light-cone energies. For massless particles,
like gluons, however, such a construction leads to three-point and four-point
correlators that vanish everywhere except for a measure zero hypersurface of
celestial coordinates. This is due to the four-dimensional momentum
conservation law that constrains the insertion points of the operators
associated with massless particles. These correlators are reminiscent of
Coulomb gas correlators that, in the absence of background charges, vanish due
to charge conservation. We supply the background momentum by coupling
Yang-Mills theory to a background dilaton field, with the (complex) dilaton
source localized on the celestial sphere. This picture emerges from the
physical interpretation of the solutions of the system of differential
equations discovered by Banerjee and Ghosh. We show that the solutions can be
written as Mellin transforms of the amplitudes evaluated in such a dilaton
background. The resultant three-gluon and four-gluon amplitudes are
single-valued functions of celestial coordinates enjoying crossing symmetry and
all other properties expected from standard CFT correlators. We use them to
extract OPEs and compare them with the OPEs extracted from multi-gluon

this level and derive the 4D gravitational constant. Considering a homogeneous
and isotropic fluid in the corresponding FLRW coordinates we find that the bulk
fluid density below the brane, which has the same equation of state as the
fluid on the brane, contributes to the energy density in the Friedmann equation
and therefore in late time may be attributed to dark matter. Studying the
stability of the setup we observe that the brane becomes stabilized, in the
presence of matter on the brane, with a de Sitter length that is qualitatively
of the order of Schwarzschild radius of the universe due to matter. We briefly
discuss effects that can bound the de Sitter lifetime. In particular, this
model can provide a lifetime compatible with Trans-Planckian Censorship
conjecture for the current de Sitter phase."

the known expression for the radiated linear momentum $P^\mu$, completes the

Using tools from scattering amplitudes and effective field theory, we calculate
the radiated $J^{\mu\nu}$ due to the scattering of two spinless particles to
third order in Newton's constant $G$, but to all orders in velocity. Our
form-factor analysis elucidates a novel relation found by Bini, Damour, and
Geralico between energy and angular momentum loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$. Our

instead on Euclidean-signature saddles for path integrals that prepare such

construct explicit examples. The spacetime metrics are real at real times and
have no conical singularities. With enough symmetry the classical metrics are
in fact smooth, though more generally their curvatures feature power-law
divergences along null congruences launched orthogonally from the fixed-area

of wormholes to the gravitational path integral and the phenomenon of replica
symmetry breaking observed in spin glasses and other disordered systems.
Interestingly, these configurations may also be important for the explanation
of the information paradox of quantum black holes. Motivated by these
developments, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a $PT$-symmetric
system composed of two random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with no explicit
coupling between them. After performing ensemble averaging, we identify
numerically and analytically a robust first-order phase transition in the free
energy of two models with quantum chaotic dynamics: the elliptic Ginibre
ensemble of random matrices and a non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.
The free energy of the Ginibre model is temperature-independent in the
low-temperature phase. The SYK model has a similar behavior for sufficiently
low temperature, then it experiences a possible continuous phase transition to
a phase with a temperature-dependent free energy before the first-order
transition takes place at a higher temperature. We identify the order parameter
of the first-order phase transition and obtain analytical expressions for the
critical temperature. The mechanism behind the transition is the existence of
replica symmetry breaking configurations coupling Left and Right replicas that
control the low-temperature limit of the partition function. We speculate that
quantum chaos may be necessary for the observed dominance of off-diagonal
replica symmetry breaking configurations in the low-temperature limit."

control over perturbative corrections to the string-derived leading-order 4d
lagrangian is crucial. Such corrections can be classified in three types:
First, there are genuine loop effects, insensitive to the UV completion of the
10d theory. Second, there are local $\alpha'$ corrections or, equivalently, 10d
higher-dimension operators which may or may not be related to loop-effects.
Third, warping corrections affect the 4d Kahler potential but are expected not
to violate the 4d no-scale structure. With this classification in mind, we
attempt to derive the Berg-Haack-Pajer conjecture for Kahler corrections in
type-IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds and extend it to include further terms. This
is crucial since the interesting applications of this conjecture are in the
context of generic Calabi-Yau geometries rather than in the torus-based models
from which the main motivation originally stems. As an important by-product, we
resolve a known apparent inconsistency between the parametric behaviour of
string loop results and field-theoretic expectations. Our findings lead to some
interesting new statements concerning loop effects associated with
blowup-cycles, loop corrections in fibre inflation, and possible logarithmic
effects in the Kahler and scalar potential."

paper, we instead look for biadjoint solutions in Euclidean signature, which
may be relatable to Yang-Mills or gravitational instantons. We show that
spherically symmetric power-like Euclidean solutions do not exist in precisely
four spacetime dimensions. The explanation for why this is the case turns out
to involve the Eguchi-Hanson instanton, whose single copy structure is found to
be more complicated (and interesting) than previously thought. We provide a
more general prescription for double-copying instantons, and explain how our
results provide a higher-dimensional complement to a recently presented
non-perturbative double copy of exact solutions in two spacetime dimensions. In
doing so, we demonstrate how the replacement of colour by kinematic Lie

corrections to extremal charged black holes to increase their charge-to-mass
ratio. This allows decay via emission of a smaller extremal black hole. In this
paper, we investigate if similar constraints hold for extremal rotating black
holes. We do so by considering the leading higher derivative corrections to the
four-dimensional Kerr black hole and five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole.
We use a known mapping of these rotating solutions to a four-dimensional
non-rotating dyonic Kaluza-Klein black hole and impose the WGC on this charged
solution. Going back again to the rotating solutions, this fixes the sign of
the corrections to the rotating extremality bounds. The sign of the corrections
is non-universal, depending on the black hole under consideration. We argue
that this is not at odds with black hole decay, because of the presence of a
superradiant instability that persists in the extremal limit. When this
instability is present, the WGC is implied for the four-dimensional charged
black hole."

How the masses and spins of new particles active during
inflation can be read off from the statistical properties of primordial density
fluctuations is well understood. However, not when the propagation speeds of
the new degrees of freedom and of the curvature perturbation differ, which is
the generic situation in the effective field theory of inflationary
fluctuations. Here we use bootstrap techniques to find exact analytical
solutions for primordial 2-,3- and 4-point correlators in this context. We
focus on the imprints of a heavy relativistic scalar coupled to the curvature
perturbation that propagates with a reduced speed of sound $c_s$, hence
strongly breaking de Sitter boosts. We show that akin to the de Sitter
invariant setup, primordial correlation functions can be deduced by acting with
suitable weight-shifting operators on the four-point function of a conformally
coupled field induced by the exchange of the massive scalar. However, this
procedure requires the analytical continuation of this seed correlator beyond
the physical domain implied by momentum conservation. We bootstrap this seed
correlator in the extended domain from first principles, starting from the
boundary equation that it satisfies due to locality. We further impose
unitarity, reflected in cosmological cutting rules, and analyticity, by
demanding regularity in the collinear limit of the four-point configuration, in
order to find the unique solution. Equipped with this, we unveil that heavy
particles that are lighter than $H/c_s$ leave smoking gun imprints in the
bispectrum in the form of resonances in the squeezed limit, a phenomenon that
we call the low speed collider. We characterise the overall shape of the signal
as well as its unusual logarithmic mass dependence, both vividly distinct from
previously identified signatures of heavy fields. (abridged)"

from this point of view. It was previously shown how to use the well-known
solitonic solutions of the KdV equation to construct ""solitonic"" electric
fields that do not create scalar pairs with an arbitrary fixed momentum. We
show that this construction can be adapted to the fermionic case in two
inequivalent ways, both leading to the vanishing of the pair-creation rate at
certain values of the P\""oschl-Teller like index $p$ of the associated

imaginary time, is used to model thermal systems. In this work, it is taken a
step further to systems with spatial thermal variation, by developing an
equivalence between the spatial variation of temperature in a thermal bath and
the curvature of the Euclidean space. The variation in temperature is recast as
a variation in the metric, leading to a curved Euclidean space. The equivalence
is substantiated by analyzing the Polyakov loop, the partition function and the
periodicity of the correlation function. The bulk thermodynamic properties like
the energy, entropy and the Helmholtz free energy are calculated from the
partition function, for small metric perturbations, for a neutral scalar field.
The Dirac equation for an external Dirac spinor, traversing in a thermal bath
with spatial thermal gradients, is solved in the curved Euclidean space. The
fundamental behavior exhibited by the Dirac spinor eigenstate, may provide a
possible mechanism to validate the theory, at a more basal level, than
examining only bulk thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, in order to verify
the equivalence at the level of classical mechanics, the geodesic equation is
analyzed in a classical backdrop. The mathematical apparatus is borrowed from
the physics of quantum theory in a gravity-induced space-time curvature. As
spatial thermal variations are obtainable at QCD or QED energies, it may be
feasible for the proposed formulation to be validated experimentally."

$\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories associated with toric
Calabi-Yau three-folds, whose BPS algebras have recently been identified as the
quiver Yangians. We start with the crystal representations of the quiver
Yangian, which are placed at each site of the spin chain. We then construct
integrable models by combining the single-site crystals into crystal chains by
a coproduct of the algebra, which we determine by a combination of
representation-theoretical and gauge-theoretical arguments. For non-chiral
quivers, we find that the Bethe ansatz equations for the crystal chain coincide
with the vacuum equation of the quiver gauge theory, thus confirming the
corresponding Gauge/Bethe correspondence. For more general chiral quivers,
however, we find obstructions to the $R$-matrices satisfying the Yang-Baxter
equations and the unitarity conditions, and hence to their corresponding
Gauge/Bethe correspondence. We also discuss trigonometric (quantum toroidal)
versions of the quiver BPS algebras, which correspond to three-dimensional
$\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories and arrive at similar conclusions. Our findings
demonstrate that there are important subtleties in the Gauge/Bethe
correspondence, often overlooked in the literature."

new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In this sense, cosmological
applications of supergravity can be the arena for probing outcomes of
supergravity. It is also attractive that supergravity can appear as a
low-energy effective theory of superstrings, a possible candidate of quantum
gravity. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to build inflationary models in
supergravity due to difficulties arising mainly from the extremely constrained
form of supergravity scalar potentials, complicated structure of interaction
terms, and excessive scalar degrees of freedom. These obstructions generally
make it challenging to contrive a desirable inflationary trajectory, perform
the moduli stabilization to obtain the stable de-Sitter phase, and make extra
scalars to be much heavier than the Hubble scale to get single field inflation.
Besides, supergravity predicts many non-renormalizable interactions. It thus
arises as effective field theory (EFT) which can be valid only up to typical
energies $E$ below its ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{cut}$, and up to some
accuracy of $(E/\Lambda_{cut})^n$ that we desire. We note that these
non-renormalizable terms may affect physics during and/or after inflation. From
such points of view, it is very important in supergravity to find the method
for relaxing the scalar potentials, and flexible scalar field dynamics
(particularly for inflaton), and examine self-consistency at the quantum level.
In this thesis, therefore, we construct locally supersymmetric effective field
theories of inflation (with KKLT string background) by taking into account
recently-proposed reformulations of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity that can
enlarge the space of scalar potentials."

dictate the dynamics of an underlying Cartan geometry. In a sense to be made
precise in the paper, the starting datum in the gauging procedure is a Klein
pair corresponding to a homogeneous space. What the gauging procedure amounts
to is the construction of a Cartan geometry modelled on that Klein geometry,
with the gauge field defining a Cartan connection. The lagrangian itself
consists of all gauge-invariant top-forms constructed from the Cartan
connection and its curvature. After demonstrating that this procedure produces
four-dimensional General Relativity upon gauging Minkowski spacetime, we
proceed to gauge all four-dimensional maximally symmetric carrollian spaces:
Carroll, (anti-)de Sitter--Carroll and the lightcone. For the first three of
these spaces, our lagrangians generalise earlier first-order lagrangians. The
resulting theories of carrollian gravity all take the same form, which seems to
be a manifestation of model mutation at the level of the lagrangians. The odd
one out, the lightcone, is not reductive and this means that although the
equations of motion take the same form as in the other cases, the geometric
interpretation is different. For all carrollian theories of gravity we obtain
analogues of the Gauss--Bonnet, Pontryagin and Nieh--Yan topological terms, as
well as two additional terms that are intrinsically carrollian and seem to have
no lorentzian counterpart. Since we gauge the theories from scratch this work
also provides a no-go result for the electric carrollian theory in a
first-order formulation."

part considers a quartic tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry and long-range
propagator. The existence of a non-perturbative fixed point in any $d$ at large
$N$ is established. We found four lines of fixed points parametrized by the
so-called tetrahedral coupling. One of them is infrared attractive, strongly
interacting and gives rise to a new kind of CFT, called melonic CFTs which are
then studied in more details. We first compute dimensions of bilinears and OPE
coefficients at the fixed point which are consistent with a unitary CFT at
large $N$. We then compute $1/N$ corrections. At next-to-leading order, the
line of fixed points collapses to one fixed point. However, the corrections are
complex and unitarity is broken at NLO. Finally, we show that this model
respects the $F$-theorem. The next part of the thesis investigates sextic
tensor field theories in rank $3$ and $5$. In rank $3$, we found two IR stable
real fixed points in short range and a line of IR stable real fixed points in
long range. Surprisingly, the only fixed point in rank $5$ is the Gaussian one.
For the rank $3$ model, in the short-range case, we still find two IR stable
fixed points at NLO. However, in the long-range case, the corrections to the
fixed points are non-perturbative and hence unreliable: we found no precursor
of the large $N$ fixed point. The last part of the thesis investigates the
class of model exhibiting a melonic large $N$ limit. We prove that models with
tensors in an irreducible representation of $O(N)$ or $Sp(N)$ in rank $5$
indeed admit a large $N$ limit. This generalization relies on recursive bounds
derived from a detailed combinatorial analysis of Feynman graphs involved in
the perturbative expansion of our model."

nongravitational quantum field theories in four-dimensional flat space. We
foliate the spacetime into a set of dS$_3$ slices that are spacelike to, and at
a constant proper distance from, an arbitrarily chosen origin, and study the
boundary dS$_3$ obtained in the infinite-distance limit. Massive bulk fields
have an exponentially small tail in this limit, and by stripping off this tail
we obtain observables that are intrinsic to the boundary dS$_3$. A single
massive field in the bulk can be decomposed into an infinite set of dS$_3$
fields, and the Minkowski vacuum corresponds to the Euclidean vacuum for these
fields. Our procedure for extrapolating bulk observables induces potential
singularities in boundary correlators but we show how they can be cured in the
free theory by smearing the boundary operators. We show that by integrating
boundary operators with suitable smearing functions it is possible to
reconstruct all local bulk operators in the free theory. We argue, using
perturbation theory, that our extrapolation procedure continues to be well
defined in the presence of interactions. We demonstrate a relationship between
the width of the boundary smearing function and the localization of the bulk
field. We study other interesting properties of the boundary algebra including
the action of global translations and the manner in which local bulk
interactions are encoded on the boundary."

conditions, we identify a one-parameter deformation of the fine-tuned stratum,

these correspond to the phonon excitations of the superfluid state. We discuss
the organization of these states into conformal multiplets and the form of the
corresponding composite operators in the free field theory limit. The latter
entails a mapping, built order-by-order in the inverse charge $n^{-1}$, between
the Fock space of vacuum fluctuations and the Fock space of fluctuations around

to an infinite-dimensional Verma module on one or both boundaries of the spin
chain, and for $q=e^{\frac{i\pi}{p}}$ a $2p$-th root of unity $ - $ to its
$p$-dimensional analogue. Both cases are parametrised by a continuous ""spin""
$\alpha\in\mathbb{C}$.
  To motivate our construction, we first specialise to $q=i$, where we obtain a
modified XX Hamiltonian with unrolled quantum group symmetry, whose spectrum
and scaling limit is computed explicitly using free fermions. In the continuum,
this model is identified with the $(\eta,\xi)$ ghost CFT on the upper-half
plane with a continuum of conformally invariant boundary conditions on the real
axis. The different sectors of the Hamiltonian are identified with irreducible
Virasoro representations.
  Going back to generic $q$ we investigate the algebraic properties of the
underlying lattice algebras. We show that if $q^\alpha\notin\pm
q^{\mathbb{Z}}$, the new boundary coupling provides a faithful representation
of the blob algebra which is Schur-Weyl dual to $U_q\mathfrak{sl}_2$. Then,
modifying the boundary conditions on both the left and the right, we obtain a
representation of the universal two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra. The
generators and parameters of these representations are computed explicitly in
terms of $q$ and $\alpha$. Finally, we conjecture the general form of the
Schur-Weyl duality in this case.

parameters, the spectrum and its continuum limit, the representation content of
the relevant lattice algebras and the fusion properties of these new spin
chains."

as toy models to probe universal properties of conformal field theory (CFT)
using the gauge/gravity duality. In this context, we are particularly
interested in generalized quasi-topological gravities, i.e., theories whose
equations of motion for statically spherically symmetric solutions are of
second order at most. Here, we characterize the number of these theories
existing at a given curvature order and dimensions. Moreover, we show that any
effective higher-curvature theory is connected, via field redefinitions to some
generalized quasi-topological gravity. The situation is special for three
spacetime dimensions, as theories of this type have trivial equations of
motion. However, when matter fields are added into the picture, the equations
of motion become non-trivial, describing, among other solutions,
multiparametric generalizations of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole.
  From the CFT side, entanglement entropy arises as a prominent quantity that
encodes important information about the field theory, such as the type A and
type B trace anomalies in even dimensions and the sphere free energy of the
theory in odd dimensions when considering spherical entangling regions. As
entanglement entropy also includes divergences, we employ the Kounterterms
scheme to extract the physically relevant quantities. In the case of
three-dimensional CFTs dual to Einstein gravity, we show that the finite part
is isolated and can be written in terms of the Willmore energy, providing an
upper bound based on its properties. We extend this remarkable result to
arbitrary CFTs under consideration. Besides, we show the validity of the
Kounterterms scheme for general quadratic curvature gravity, extracting the
type A, type B anomalies of the theory in even dimensions and the sphere free
energy in odd ones."

solution induces a tadpole for the open strings which shifts the open string
vacuum and generates a cosmological constant composed of two terms: one which
is directly related to the closed string solution and the other which depends
on the open string vacuum shift. We show that only the sum of these two terms
is invariant under closed SFT gauge transformations and therefore is an
observable. We conjecture that this observable is universally proportional to
the shift in the world-sheet disk partition function between the starting
D-brane in undeformed background and the final D-brane in deformed background,
which typically includes also a change in the string coupling constant. We test
the conjecture by considering a perturbative closed string solution describing
deformations of a Narain compactification and, from the SFT cosmological

branch description in terms of a generalized quiver gauge theory consisting of

For theories obtained from M5-branes probing an ADE singularity, this was
recently leveraged to extract a protected large R-charge subsector of
operators, with operator mixing controlled at leading order in an inverse large
R-charge expansion by an integrable spin $s$ Heisenberg spin chain, where $s$
is determined by the $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{R}$ R-symmetry representation of the
conformal matter operator. In this work, we show that this same structure
extends to the full superconformal algebra $\mathfrak{osp}(6,2|1)$. In
particular, we determine the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations which govern
this super-spin chain, as well as distinguished subsectors which close under

leading Regge trajectory in D=4. We find that these coefficients always remain
positive, even though their magnitude decreases with spin. Since the

supergeometric data), organised into simplicial hierarchies, is considered. To
these, configurational (super)symmetry of the bulk field theory is lifted
coherently, whereby the notion of a maximally (super)symmetric background, and
in particular that of a simplicial Lie background, arises as the target
structure requisite for the definition of the super-$\sigma$-model with defects
fully transmissive to the currents of the bulk (super)symmetry. The formal
concepts are illustrated in two settings of physical relevance: that of the WZW
$\sigma$-model of the bosonic string in a compact simple 1-connected Lie group
and that of the GS super-$\sigma$-model of the superstring in the Minkowski
super-space. In the former setting, the structure of the background is fixed
through a combination of simplicial, symmetry(-reducibility) and cohomological
arguments, and a novel link between fusion of the maximally symmetric WZW
defects of Fuchs et al. and the 3$d$ CS theory with timelike Wilson lines with
fixed holonomy is established. Moreover, a purely geometric interpretation of
the Verlinde fusion rules is proposed. In the latter setting, a multiplicative
structure compatible with supersymmetry is shown to exist on the GS
super-1-gerbe of arXiv:1706.05682 [hep-th], and subsequently used in a novel
construction of a class of maximally (rigidly) supersymmetric bi-branes whose
elementary fusion is also studied."

the wormhole-type correlations are associated with different phases and add up
to zero in two replica quantities. Correspondingly, when we consider the JT
gravity with $n$ different asymptotic boundaries each of which has $k$
degenerate vacua, the transition between different vacua introduces an extra
factor in the transition amplitude between different boundaries. It is shown
that similar to the SYK model, the extra factors ensure that all the bulk

is also related to a discrete symmetry of the SYK model. We further show that

V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2+\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4 (m^2 >0) non-minimally
coupled to gravity is studied in two-measures theory (TMT) in the Palatini
formalism. In the equations of motion presented in the Einstein frame and
rewritten in terms of the canonically normalized scalar field \varphi, there
arises a TMT effective potential, which differs from the potential of the
T-model in that it has a plateau of finite length: for \varphi greater a
certain value varphi_0 the TMT effective potential becomes exponentially steep.
The length of the plateau, and hence the duration of a quasi-de Sitter
inflation, is controlled by a model parameter. The appearance of this
parameter, as well as the form of the TMT effective potential, are a direct
consequence of the features inherent only in TMT. A detailed analysis shows
that there is a rather narrow interval of initial values of \varphi, bounded
from above by \varphi_0, in which the initial kinetic \rho_{kin,in} and
gradient \rho_{grad,in} energy densities turn out to be less than the potential
energy density; this requires the only additional condition, which is that
\rho_{kin,in}>\rho_{grad,in}. Therefore, in the space-time domain where these
restrictions are satisfied, the initial conditions necessary for inflation are
guaranteed."

polynomials in the spectral parameter. These polynomials are determined
recursively by linear algebraic equations relating different $N$ and $p$, such
that all integrated correlators are ultimately fixed in terms of the integrated
stress tensor multiplets in the $SU(2)$ theory. Our computations include the
full matrix of integrated correlators at low values of $p$, and a certain
infinite class involving operators of arbitrary $p$. The latter satisfy an open
lattice chain equation for all $N$, reminiscent of the Toda equation obeyed by

certain integrable systems has been the subject of several recent studies. In
this paper we focus on the stationary value of the entanglement entropy
density, its growth rate, and related functions, after a quantum quench. We
consider several quenches, each of which is characterised by a corresponding
squeezed coherent state. In the quench action approach, the coherent state
amplitudes $K(\theta)$ become input data that fully characterise the large-time
stationary state, thus also the corresponding Yang-Yang entropy. We find that,
as function of the mass of the unstable particle, the entropy growth rate has a
global minimum signalling the depletion of entropy that accompanies a slowdown
of stable quasiparticles at the threshold for the formation of an unstable
excitation. We also observe a separation of scales governed by the interplay
between the mass of the unstable particle and the quench parameter, separating
a non-interacting regime described by free fermions from an interacting regime
where the unstable particle is present. This separation of scales leads to a
double-plateau structure of many functions, where the relative height of the
plateaux is related to the ratio of central charges of the UV fixed points
associated with the two regimes, in full agreement with conformal field theory
predictions. The properties of several other functions of the entropy and its
growth rate are also studied in detail, both for fixed quench parameter and
varying unstable particle mass and viceversa."

the confined/deconfined phases of a bottom-up AdS/QCD model in the presence of
a background magnetic field. We analyse the entanglement entropy, entanglement
wedge cross-section, mutual information, and entanglement negativity and
investigate how a background magnetic field leaves its imprints on the
entanglement structure of these measures. Due to the anisotropy introduced by
the magnetic field, we find that the behaviour of these measures depends
nontrivially on the relative orientation of the strip with respect to the
field. In the confining phase, the entanglement entropy and negativity undergo
a phase transition at the same critical strip length, the magnitude of which
increases/decreases for parallel/perpendicular orientation of the magnetic
field. The entanglement wedge cross-section similarly displays discontinuous
behaviour each time a phase transition between different entangling surfaces
occurs, while further exhibiting anisotropic features with a magnetic field. We
further find that the magnetic field also introduces substantial changes in the
entanglement measures of the deconfined phase, however, these changes remain
qualitatively similar for all orientations of the magnetic field. We further
study the inequality involving entanglement wedge and mutual information and
find that the former always exceeds half of the latter everywhere in the

correspond to renormalons at unexpected positions in the Borel plane. We test
the trans-series numerically and at large N. We also study what happens to

amplitude singularities, we define an extended positive space, which enhances
the Grassmannian space featuring at tree level, and a map which associates to
each of its points tree-level kinematic variables and loop momenta. The image
of this map is the loop momentum amplituhedron. Importantly, our formulation
provides a global definition of the loop momenta. We conjecture that for all

$N$ fermions with a $q$-body interaction of infinite range, coupled to a
Markovian environment. Close to the steady state, the real-time Lindbladian
dynamics of this system at infinite temperature is identical to the
near-zero-temperature dynamics in Euclidean time of a two-site non-Hermitian
SYK with inter-site coupling whose gravity dual has been recently related to
wormhole configurations. We show that the saddle-point equations in the
real-time formulation are identical to those in Euclidean time. Indeed, an
explicit calculation of Green's functions at low temperature, numerical for $q
= 4$ and analytical for $q = 2$ and large $q$, illustrates this equivalence.
Only for very strong coupling does the decay rate approach the linear
dependence on the coupling characteristic of a dissipation-driven approach to
the steady state. For $q > 2$, we identify a potential gravity dual of the
real-time dissipative SYK model: a double-trumpet configuration in a near-de
Sitter space in two dimensions with matter. This configuration, which we term a
Keldysh wormhole, is responsible for a finite decay rate even in the absence of
coupling to the environment."

compactifications with fluxes, from the 4d and the 10d point of view.
  We start by reviewing type IIA Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications with
fluxes. We consider RR and NSNS fluxes, and then add (non)-geometric fluxes. We
recall how the potential can be written as a bilinear expression and review the
main swampland conjectures involving these scenarios.
  Once the basics have been setted, we perform a systematic search of vacua,
using directly the 4d action. We focus first on the case with RR and NSNS
fluxes and then repeat the same game by including geometric fluxes. We find
several families of SUSY and non-SUSY AdS$_4$ vacua. We check which of them are
(perturbatively) stable and which have separation of scales.
  We then analyse from the 10d perspective the SUSY vacua derived in the 4d
effective theory. We comment on how an uplift to $SU(3)$ structure manifolds
does not exist unless the O6 planes are smeared. We go beyond this
approximation and look for an uplift in $SU(3)\times SU(3)$ manifolds,
considering only the case with RR and NSNS fluxes. To do so, we expand the
equations of motion in terms of $g_s$. At zeroth order we recover the smearing
approximation. We solve the expansion at first order, where the localised
nature of the O6-planes is taken into account.
  We use the same machinery to study the non-perturbative stability of some of
the families of non-SUSY vacua with only RR and NSNS fluxes. According to a
refined version of the weak gravity conjecture, there should be membranes in
the spectrum with $Q > T$, triggering its decay. We see that D8 branes wrapping
the internal manifold with D6 branes ending on them can satisfy this
requirement.
  We finish by recapping all the results and making some comments about which
questions are still open."

general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame

dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole. We argue that in the limit

temperature, $T_H$, it can be described in terms of a generalized version of
the Horowitz-Polchinski effective theory. For $d\geq6$, where the
Horowitz-Polchinski EFT [1,2] does not have suitable solutions, the modified
effective Lagrangian allows one to study the black hole CFT in an expansion in
powers of $d-6$ and $T_H-T$. At $T=T_H$, the sigma model is non-trivial for all
$d>6$. It exhibits an enhanced $SU(2)$ symmetry, and is described by a
non-abelian Thirring model with a radially dependent coupling. The resulting
picture connects naturally to the results of [3-5], that relate Schwarzschild
black holes in flat spacetime at large $d$ to the two dimensional black hole.
We also discuss an analogous open string system, in which the black hole is
replaced by a system of two separated D-branes connected by a throat. In this
system, the asymptotic separation of the branes plays the role of the inverse
temperature. At the critical separation, the system is described by a
Kondo-type model, which again exhibits an enhanced $SU(2)$ symmetry. At large

a finite number of states at each resonance. These amplitudes take an
infinite-product form and, depending on parameters, exhibit mass spectra that

converge to an accumulation point, a peculiar feature seen in the Coon

previous conjectured formulae. This gives a systematic understanding of the
relation between properties of these correlators at finite $N$ and their
expansions at large $N$. In particular, it determines a duality-invariant
non-perturbative completion of the large-$N$ expansion in terms of a sum of
novel non-holomorphic modular functions. These functions are exponentially
suppressed at large $N$ and have the form of a sum of contributions from
coincident $(p, q)$-string world-sheet instantons."

with the time-dependent source of scalar field in asymptotically anti-de Sitter
(AdS) spacetime. The numerical results reveal a novel descalarization
mechanism. In order to obtain the hairy black hole as the initial data for the
quench process, we first analyze the quasi-normal modes of the massive complex
scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\""om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole
background. We find the dominant unstable modes for large and small RN-AdS
black holes come from the zero-damped modes and AdS modes, respectively. Then,
the unstable RN-AdS black holes are perturbed to trigger the transition to
hairy black holes. With the hairy black hole in hand, we specify a time
dependent scalar source for the system. As the source is turned on, the
electric charge, energy and scalar condensation of the system start to
oscillate with the entropy increasing monotonically. Finally, with the decay of
the scalar source, the system gradually settles down to a new state.
Interestingly, the final state of the evolution could be a hairy black hole
with less scalar condensation, a RN-AdS black hole or a Schwarzschild-AdS black
hole, which depends on the quench strength. However, as long as the quench
strength is large enough, the system always loses all the electric charge and
converges to the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole."

minimal energy under the static balance in nonextremal charged black holes, and
(iii) charges in the Sauter-type electric fields. We then compared the results
from the monodromy with those from the exact wave functions in terms of the
hypergeometric functions with three regular singular points. The explicit

to a gluing transformation and the latter to an overall large diffeomorphism,

extension to more general transformations leads us to argue that a given index
can be factorized in terms of a family of holomorphic blocks parametrized by
modular (congruence sub)groups. We find precise agreement between this proposal
and new modular properties of the elliptic $\Gamma$ function. This allows us to
establish the ``modular factorization'' of superconformal lens indices of

prove that a normalized part of superconformal lens indices defines a

explicitly we show that, in a quantum system when the state of a subset is
totally encoded in the state of another subset, the Hilbert space of the system
will reduce, and the way we compute the reduced density matrix and related
entropy quantities will also change essentially. Such reductions of the Hilbert

Investigating the conditions for the formation of black holes, we notice that
quantum effects modify the geometry and structure of Schwarzschild space-time
in such a way that black holes have two horizons, an inner and an outer
horizon. If the gravitational mass of the shell is about that of an ordinary

prevent the creation of the singularity. Although under certain conditions, it
is possible to form a non-singular black hole, i.e., a regular black hole. In

equivalent to light transformed correlators on the celestial torus. Using an
ambidextrous basis of twistor and dual twistor variables, we derive formulae
for the three and four point YM and gravity amplitudes. The four point
amplitudes take a particularly simple form in terms of elementary functions,
with a remarkable similarity between the YM and gravity expressions. We find
celestial twistor BCFW recursion relations and show how these may be used to
generate the four point YM amplitude, highlighting features that should enable
the calculation of higher multiplicity light transformed correlators.
Throughout our calculations we utilise the unique properties of the boundary
structure of split signature, and in order to properly motivate and highlight
these properties we first develop our methodology in Lorentzian signature. This
also allows us to prove a correspondence between Fourier transforms and shadow
transforms."

Depending on
whether the coupling is positive or negative, the system displays metallic or
insulating behavior in its normal state. An essential property is the
appearance of a mid-IR peak in the alternating current (AC) conductivity in
certain parameters. The mid-IR peak originates from the competition between
explicit symmetry breaking (ESB) and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), which
results in the pseudo-Goldstone mode. Moreover, a dip in low-frequency AC
conductivity might be noticed. Such a dip can be understood phenomenologically
as vortex-like behavior, which can be attributed to the SSB Goldstone mode's
excitation. In the superconducting phase, the effect on the condensation or
superconducting energy gap from the gauge-axion coupling is amplified only in
strong momentum dissipation. In particular, a hard-gap-like behavior at low
frequency and a pronounced peak at intermediate frequency would be seen for the
case with negative gauge-axion coupling, showing that the evolution of the
superfluid component is distinct from that of positive coupling."

erased when encountering a defect, either solitonic or a $D$-brane that
deconfines their fluxes. This leads to a novel mechanism of cosmic string
break-up, accompanied by gravitational and electromagnetic radiations. The
arguments based on loss of coherence and the entropy count suggest that the
erasure probability is very close to one, and strings never make it through the

consistency with the linearized-Kerr 3-point amplitude, to all orders in the
black hole's spin. We then explore the extent to which a unique classical
Compton amplitude can be identified by comparing with the results of the
classical process of scattering long-wavelength gravitational waves off an
exact Kerr black hole, determined by appropriate solutions of the Teukolsky
equation. Up to fourth order in spin, we find complete agreement with a
previously conjectured exponential form of the tree-level Compton amplitude. At
higher orders, we extract tree-level contributions from the Teukolsky amplitude
by an analytic continuation from a physical ($a/GM<1$) to a particle-like

\textit{conservative} part of the amplitude which is insensitive both to the
choice of boundary conditions at the black hole horizon and to branch choices

to corrections to the potential at large distances. Beyond the Hubble radius,
the potential vanishes identically, in agreement with the causal structure of
de Sitter spacetime. For sub-Hubble distances, we investigate whether the

these theories realize unusual RG flows where higher dimensional (seemingly
irrelevant) operators become relevant even at weak coupling. Finally, we
present an example of a field theory whose vacuum energy relaxes to a
hierarchically small value compared to the UV cut-off."

conjectural basis of master integrals at an arbitrary number of loops, and we
solve the system of differential equations satisfied by the master integrals in
terms of the same class of iterated integrals that have appeared earlier in the
context of equal-mass banana integrals. We then go on and show that, when
expressed in terms of the canonical coordinate on the moduli space, our results
can naturally be written as iterated integrals involving the geometrical
invariants of the Calabi-Yau varieties. Our results indicate how the concept of
pure functions and transcendental weight can be extended to the case of
Calabi-Yau varieties. Finally, we also obtain a novel representation of the
periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties in terms of the same class of iterated
integrals, and we show that the well-known quadratic relations among the

fields are constant throughout space-time, and explore decay channels for which
decay into BPS and anti-BPS constituents is energetically favorable. We
demonstrate the existence of decay channels at tree level for large families of
double extremal black holes. For specific charges, we also find stable
non-supersymmetric black holes, suggesting recombination of
(anti)-supersymmetric constituents to a non-supersymmetric object."
15248,"Nevertheless, still guided by the motivation of ﬁnding discrete holographic dualities, we en-
vision several possible interesting paths for further research, with the goal of introducing the
above features:

    First, a promising avenue consists of considering models such as chains [74] involving
the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model [48, 49].","Instead, they have SO(N ) as a global symmetry group.","At low energies and for large N , the (0 + 1)-

theories defined on a discrete tiling of the hyperbolic plane, we consider a
recently proposed boundary spin chain Hamiltonian with aperiodic couplings that
are chosen such as to reflect the inflation rule, i.e. the construction
principle, of the bulk tiling. As a remnant of conformal symmetry, the spin
degrees of freedom are arranged in multiplets of the dihedral group under which
the bulk lattice is invariant. For the boundary Hamiltonian, we use
strong-disorder RG techniques and evaluate correlation functions, the
entanglement entropy and mutual information for the case that the ground state
is in an aperiodic singlet phase. We find that two-point functions decay as a
power-law with exponent equal to one. Furthermore, we consider the case that
the spin variables transform in the fundamental representation of $SO(N)$,
leading to a gapless system, and find that the effective central charge
obtained from the entanglement entropy scales as $\ln N$, reflecting the number
of local degrees of freedom. We also determine the dependence of this central
charge on the parameters specifying the bulk tiling. Moreover, we obtain an
analytical expression for the mutual information, according to which there is
no phase transition at any finite value of the distance between the two
intervals involved."
15289,"It will be interesting to further study the large c
limit, in particular for non-vacuum descendants, to analyse the holographic eﬀect
of these diﬀerent behaviours.","This means that a typical state will be a descendant at large but
ﬁnite central charge c. The results we present here show that descendants with the
same conformal dimension can in fact show very diﬀerent behaviour when it comes
to the entanglement structure.","Finally, in ﬁgure 3.3 (c) and (d) we show the correlator F (3) for the ﬁrst two
excited states L−2|0 and L−3|0 .",2022-12-22 16:09:18+00:00,Aspects of Conformal Field Theory,hep-th,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Matteo Broccoli')],"In this thesis we analyse three aspects of Conformal Field Theories (CFTs).
First, we consider correlation functions of descendant states in
two-dimensional CFTs. We discuss a recursive formula to calculate them and
provide a computer implementation of it. This allows us to obtain any
correlation function of vacuum descendants, and for non-vacuum descendants to
express the correlator as a differential operator acting on the respective
primary correlator. With this code, we study some entanglement and
distinguishability measures between descendant states, i.e. the R\'enyi
entropy, trace square distance and sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. With our
results we can test the R\'enyi Quantum Null Energy Condition and provide new
tools to analyse the holographic description of descendant states. Second, we
study four-dimensional Weyl fermions on different backgrounds. Our interest is
in their trace anomaly, where the Pontryagin density has been claimed to
appear. To ascertain this possibility, we compute the anomalies of Dirac
fermions coupled to vector and axial non-abelian gauge fields and then in a
metric-axial-tensor background. Appropriate limits of the backgrounds allow to
recover the anomalies of Weyl fermions coupled to non-abelian gauge fields and
in a curved spacetime. In both cases we confirm the absence of the Pontryagin
density in the trace anomalies. Third, we provide the holographic description
of a four-dimensional CFT with an irrelevant operator. When the operator has
integer conformal dimension, its presence in the CFT modifies the Weyl
transformation of the metric, which in turns modifies the trace anomaly.
Exploiting the equivalence between bulk diffeomorphisms and boundary Weyl
transformations, we compute these modifications from the dual gravity theory.
Our results represent an additional test of the AdS/CFT conjecture."
15334,"Nevertheless, we
believe it is important to further study the potential implications of these non-perturbative
contributions, in particular how they might contribute to relevant observables, such as
late-time correlators [24].","Although AdS/CFT has provided strong hints that saddle points
in the partition function of Euclidean Einstein gravity have an important role to play,
it is not obvious whether this can be generalized to de Sitter space.","The hope is, of course, that these corrections are such that
these observables behave as they are expected from a unitary (holographic) microscopic
perspective.",2022-12-24 11:08:47+00:00,"Action, entropy and pair creation rate of charged black holes in de Sitter space",hep-th,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Edward K.

helps to clear up a confusion about the Euclidean actions of extremal and
ultracold black holes in de Sitter, as they can be understood as special cases
of the general expression. We then use this result to estimate the probability
for the pair creation of black holes with arbitrary mass and charge in an empty
de Sitter background, by employing the formalism of constrained instantons.
Finally, we comment that the decay of charged de Sitter black holes is expected
to be governed by the gradient flow of the entropy function, and that as a
consequence, as long as the regime of light, superradiant, rapid charge
emission is excluded, the effective decay may be described by the tunneling
formalism."
