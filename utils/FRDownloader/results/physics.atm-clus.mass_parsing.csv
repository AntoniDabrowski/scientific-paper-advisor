729,"Firstly, the magnetic properties
of porphyrin molecules are still open to further research works.","For the future outlook of my research works, I will mainly continue my study on the properties
of both porphyrin molecules and artificial graphene nanoflakes.","For example, the magnetic
moment contributed by the center metalated atom can be influenced by the some factors in
experiments.",2022-01-18 16:05:46+00:00,"Characterization of the Magnetism and Conformation of Single Porphyrin Molecules Adsorbed on Surfaces, and Artificial Graphene Nanoflakes",physics.atm-clus,['physics.atm-clus'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Qiushi Zhang')],"My thesis mostly focusses on the systems of porphyrin molecules adsorbed on
single-crystalline metallic surfaces. Cyclic tetrapyrrole porphyrins play key
roles in many important chemical and biological processes, such as oxygen
transport in heme (iron porphyrin), electron transfer and oxidation reactions
in photosynthetic chlorophyll (magnesium porphyrin). Comprehensive
understanding of the magnetic and conformational properties of single porphyrin
molecules adsorbed on metallic substrates attracts intensive research interest.
In my thesis, I have studied the structural and electronics properties of
porphyrin molecules by Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy (LT-STM)
and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and theoretical methods. Owing to the
high resolution of LT-STM, both geometric and electronic properties at the
atomic level were probed. Moreover, the experimental results were understood by
comprehensive theoretical methods, i.e. density functional theory, molecular
dynamics, tight-binding and plane-wave expansion calculations."
