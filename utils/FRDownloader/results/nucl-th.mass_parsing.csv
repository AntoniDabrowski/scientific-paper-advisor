deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the

included simultaneously, 2583 even-even nuclei are predicted to be bound. The
calculated binding energies, two-nucleon separation energies, root-mean-square
(rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole
deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared
with available experimental data. The rms deviation from the 637 mass data is
1.518 MeV, providing one of the best microscopic descriptions for nuclear
masses. The drip lines obtained from DRHBc calculations are compared with other
calculations, including the spherical relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov
(RCHB) and triaxial relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (TRHB) calculations with
PC-PK1. The deformation and continuum effects on the limits of the nuclear
landscape are discussed. Possible peninsulas consisting of bound nuclei beyond
the two-neutron drip line are predicted. The systematics of the two-nucleon
separation energies, two-nucleon gaps, rms radii, quadrupole deformations,
potential energy curves, neutron densities, neutron mean-field potentials, and
pairing energies in the DRHBc calculations are also discussed. In addition, the
$\alpha$ decay energies extracted are in good agreement with available data."

$^{12}_{\Xi}$Be with a relativistic mean field (RMF) model with meson exchange
$\Xi N$ interactions. The RMF parameters are optimized to reproduce the average
energy of KINKA and IRRAWADDY events for the ground state and also the average
energy of KISO and IBUKI events for the excited state in $^{15}_{\Xi}$C. The
potential depth of average $\Xi N$ mean field potential is found to be about
$-12$ MeV in the nuclear matter limit. We further introduce the two-body $s$-
and $p$-wave interactions between valence nucleons and $\Xi$ particle. We found
that the $s$-wave interaction deduced from the HAL LQCD results is rather weak
to obtain the energy difference between IRRAWADDY and KINKA events. The
$p$-wave interaction is added and fitted to reproduce the energy difference.
The resulting interaction together with the $s$-wave one gives a reasonable
energy simultanously for the IBUKI event as an excited $\Xi_p$ state. The model
is further applied to predict the energy spectrum of $^{12}_{\Xi}$Be."

approximation on top of a Skryme energy density functional is applied with an
assumption of spherical symmetry. The isoscalar pairing strength is estimated
by a Bayesian neutral network (BNN). We verify the predicted isoscalar pairing

the finite-range isovector pairing ensures the $\beta$-decay half-lives
insensitive to the model space, while the zero-range one was largely dependent
on it. The half-lives calculated with the BNN isoscalar pairing strengths
reproduced most of experimental data, although those of highly deformed nuclei
were underestimated. We also studied that the predictive performance on new

important ingredients for direct reactions. To simplify the analysis, we use a
pedagogical one-dimensional model and evolve toward low RG resolution using the

ranging from finite nuclei to nuclear matter and compact stars. Although with
some specific features for nuclear systems, the mechanism of pairing between
nucleons in these systems resembles that of electrons in superconductors. The
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, the first successful and microscopic
theory for superconductivity, and the Bogoliubov transformation, the
generalization of the BCS theory, have been widely used to describe pairing
correlations in nuclear systems. To deal with the problem of particle number
non-conservation in the BCS method and generalized Bogoliubov transformation,
particle number projection techniques as well as several approaches which keep
the particle number conserved, have been proposed. In the study of exotic
nuclei, which are quantum open systems, the continuum contributions have to be
taken into account. In this chapter, a thorough but brief discussion of pairing
effects in nuclear systems will be introduced. Then nuclear models dealing with
pairing correlations in nuclear structure properties will be presented to
different extent of details. Although formulas are given, the emphasis is
mainly put on the basic ideas concerning these models."

reported in the previous works related to first-order spin hydrodynamics. These
two new transport coefficients characterize the cross effects between the
symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the energy momentum tensor in spin
hydrodynamics. Starting from a general and routine entropy analysis, we show
how to identify cross effects from the entropy production, and then a more
rigorous verification is given based on the method of non-equilibrium
statistical operator. Also with recourse to the non-equilibrium statistical
operator, we have derived the Kubo formulas for transport coefficients,
expressing them in terms of retarded Green functions. Given specific
interactions, these formulas can be used to extract new transport coefficients
from underlying field theories. Later on, a comprehensive linear mode analysis
is provided to seek the dispersion relations of normal modes in first order
spin hydrodynamics. Aside from well-known conventional hydrodynamic modes, we
find six gapped non-hydrodynamic modes reflecting the non-conserved property of
spin densities. Compared with other related studies, our results demonstrate

mean-field models, there is a large and growing body of evidence which
indicates an important additional role played by spatially-correlated
nucleon-nucleon structures. The role of nucleonic structures was first
suggested by Heidmann in 1950 to explain pick-up reactions of energetic
nucleons. Since then a steady flux of new experimental evidence has confirmed
the presence of similar structures inside atomic nuclei, dominated by
correlations between pairs of nucleons. The role of these internal
nucleon-nucleon correlations has been established using various energetic
probes like photons, pions, leptons and hadrons. These correlated structures
are essential for understanding the interaction of particles with nuclei and
their presence provides an explanation of many specific nuclear phenomena
including backscattered protons, copious deuteron production, sub-threshold
particle production, neutrino interactions with nuclei and the EMC effect. On
the theoretical side, these measurements have stimulated a large number of
phenomenological models specifically devised to address these enigmatic
observations. While reviews exist for specific interactions, there is currently
no published commentary which systematically encompasses the wide range of
experimental signatures and theoretical frameworks developed thus far. The
present review draws together the synergies between a wide range of different

theoretical reaction model uncertainties, especially with respect to nuclear
optical potentials. We first describe the primary physics motivations for an
improved description of nuclear reactions involving short-lived isotopes,
focusing on applications to astrophysics, medicine, energy, and security. We
then outline the various methods in use today to extract optical potentials
starting from phenomenological, microscopic, and ab initio methods,

then discuss publicly-available tools and resources facilitating the

by a complex spherical well in coordinate space. Changing the radius of the
spherical well means changing the cutoff. We check the cutoff dependence of the

that contact interactions are needed at leading order in channels where the
singular tensor potentials of OPE are attractive. Results are compared with the
energy-dependent partial-wave analysis of $\overline{N}\!N$ scattering data.

from uncontrolled uncertainties, which attracted considerable attention
recently, such as in the context of the PREX experiment.
  $Purpose:$ Our aim is to analyze the sensitivity of charge-exchange ($p, n$)
reactions to the neutron density distribution $\rho_{n}$ and constrain the
neutron characteristics in the nuclear structure models.
  $Method:$ By combing the folding and the mean-field models, the
nucleon-nucleus ($NA$) potential can be obtained from the nuclear density
distribution. Further, the ($p, p$) and ($p, n$) cross sections for $^{48}$Ca
and $^{208}$Pb are calculated following the distorted-wave Born approximation
(DWBA) method.
  $Results:$ Compared with the ($p, p$) cross section, the effects of
$\rho_{n}$ variation on the ($p, n$) cross section are significant, which is
due to the impact of isovector properties. Based on the global folding model
analyses of data, it is found that $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb have relatively
large neutron skin thickness $\Delta R_{n p}$.
  $Conclusions:$ Results illustrate that the charge-exchange ($p, n$) reaction
is a sensitive probe of $\rho_{n}$. The results in this paper can offer useful
guides for future experiments of neutron characteristics."

in-medium nucleon are the key quantities in the Relativistic
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory. It depends on how to extract the scalar
and the vector components of the single-particle potential inside nuclear
matter. In contrast to the RBHF calculations in the Dirac space with the
positive-energy states (PESs) only, the single-particle potential can be
determined in a unique way by the RBHF theory together with the negative-energy
states (NESs), i.e., the RBHF theory in the full Dirac space. The saturation
properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter in the full Dirac space
are systematically investigated based on the realistic Bonn nucleon-nucleon
potentials. In order to further specify the importance of the calculations in
the full Dirac space, the neutron star properties are investigated. The direct
URCA process in neutron star cooling will happen at density

deformabilities are $\Lambda_{1.4M_\odot}=376,~405,~433$ for potential Bonn A,
B, C. Comparing with the results obtained in the Dirac space with PESs only,
full-Dirac-space RBHF calculation predicts the softest symmetry energy which
would be more favored by the gravitational waves (GW) detection from GW170817.
Furthermore, the results from full-Dirac-space RBHF theory are consistent with
the recent astronomical observations of massive neutron stars and simultaneous
mass-radius measurement."

assess their properties with the increase of neutrons in target nucleus, and
compare with other relevant neutron induced reactions. Model calculations of
the cross sections are based on the statistical Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS

The calculations of $(n,\alpha)$ reactions in Fe and Sn isotopes provide the
insight into their isospin dependence and properties over the complete relevant
range of neutron energies. The results show the evolution of the cross sections
with pronounced maxima at low-mass isotopes, and rather strong decrease for
neutron-rich nuclei consistent with the reduction of the reaction $Q$-value and
increased contributions from other exit channels from compound nucleus. The
analysis of the Maxwellian averaged cross sections at temperatures in stellar

low-mass isotopes, in neutron induced reactions with nuclei with neutron
excess, $\gamma$ and neutron emission dominate."
