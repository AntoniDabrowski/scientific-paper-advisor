history, particularly for genetics, given the field's perceived importance for
understanding between-group differences. The historical and potential harms
that come with irresponsible use of these categories suggests a clear need for
definitive guidance about when and how they can be used appropriately. However,
while many prior authors have provided such guidance, no established consensus
exists, and the extant literature has not been examined for implied consensus
and sources of disagreement. Here we present the results of a systematic review
of published normative recommendations regarding the use of population
categories, particularly in genetics research. Following PRISMA guidelines, we
extracted recommendations from n=121 articles matching inclusion criteria.
Articles were published consistently throughout the time period examined and in
a broad range of journals, demonstrating an ongoing and interdisciplinary
perceived need for guidance. Examined recommendations fall under one of eight
themes identified during analysis. Seven are characterized by broad agreement
across articles; one, Appropriate definitions of population categories and
contexts for use, revealed substantial fundamental disagreement among articles.
While many articles focus on the inappropriate use of race, none fundamentally
problematize ancestry. This work can be a resource to researchers looking for
normative guidance on the use of population descriptors, and can orient authors
of future guidelines to this complex field, contributing to the development of
more effective future guidelines for genetics research."
