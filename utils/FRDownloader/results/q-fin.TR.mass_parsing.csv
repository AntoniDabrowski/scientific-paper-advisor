In what follows, we consider a Gaussian prior on the drifts, such that the dynamics of the prices S in the appropriate
ﬁltration is given by (6) and (9).",Let τ < T .,2022-02-15 16:49:19+00:00,Rigorous multi-asset optimal execution with Bayesian learning of the drift,q-fin.TR,"['q-fin.TR', 'q-fin.MF']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Fayçal Drissi')],"Liquidity issues have been increasingly addressed recently, especially with
regards to optimal execution of large orders. In practice, agents facing these
issues are uncertain about the future dynamics of the assets, and face the risk
of model misspecification, which could make the execution strategies non
optimal. In this paper, we address the problem of uncertainty faced by an agent
wishing to execute large orders on multiple assets. The agent only has
knowledge about the distribution of the future drift of the assets composing
her portfolio. We build on the work in [13] who proposed a model coupling
Bayesian learning and dynamic programming techniques. More precisely, in this
article, we provide a rigorous solution to the problem of portfolio optimal
execution where prices have drifted Bachelier dynamics with an unknown drift.
The agent uses Bayesian learning to update her estimation of the drift, while
she maximizes the expected exponential utility of her final wealth. We consider
the specific case where the prior is a non-degenerate multivariate Gaussian,
and the costs are quadratic. We use stochastic optimal control tools to show
how the problem of optimal execution simplifies into a system of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) which involves a matrix Riccati ODE with
time-dependent coefficients for which classical existence theorems do not
apply. However, using a method similar to the one in [10], we provide a
rigorous solution to the problem by using a priori estimates obtained thanks to
the original control problem."

financial prices is transient. However, from a theoretical standpoint, the
origin of this temporary nature is still unclear. We show that an implied
transient impact arises from the Nash equilibrium between a directional trader
and one arbitrageur in a market impact game with fixed and permanent impact.
The implied impact is the one that can be empirically inferred from the
directional trader's trading profile and price reaction to order flow.
Specifically, we propose two approaches to derive the functional form of the
decay kernel of the Transient Impact Model, one of the most popular empirical
models for transient impact, from the behaviour of the directional trader at
the Nash equilibrium. The first is based on the relationship between past order
flow and future price change, while in the second we solve an inverse optimal
execution problem. We show that in the first approach the implied kernel is
unique, while in the second case infinite solutions exist and a linear kernel
can always be inferred."

January 2019-September 2021, investigating how their composition and the
trading activity changed around the Covid-19 lockdown period (March 9 - May 19,
2020) and more generally in the period of the pandemic. The results pinpoint
that the lockdown restriction was accompanied by a surge in interest toward
stock market, as testified by the trading volume by households. Given the
generically falling prices during the lockdown, the households, which are
typically contrarian, were net buyers, even if less than expected from their
trading activity in 2019. This can be explained by the arrival, during the
lockdown, of a group of about 185k new investors (i.e. which had never traded
since January 2019) which were on average ten year younger and with a larger
fraction of males than the pre-lockdown investors. By looking at the gross P&L,
there is clear evidence that these new investors were more skilled in trading.
There are thus indications that the lockdown, and more generally the Covid
pandemic, created a sort of regime change in the population of financial
investors."

platform with on-chain custody and settlement functions, alongside off-chain
predictive reinforcement learning capabilities to improve liquidity provision
of real-world AMMs. The proposed AMM architecture is an augmentation to the
Uniswap V3, a cryptocurrency AMM protocol, by utilizing a novel market
equilibrium pricing for reduced divergence and slippage loss. Further, the
proposed architecture involves a predictive AMM capability, utilizing a deep
hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Q-learning reinforcement learning
framework that looks to improve market efficiency through better forecasts of
liquidity concentration ranges, so liquidity starts moving to expected
concentration ranges, prior to asset price movement, so that liquidity
utilization is improved. The augmented protocol framework is expected have
practical real-world implications, by (i) reducing divergence loss for
liquidity providers, (ii) reducing slippage for crypto-asset traders, while
(iii) improving capital efficiency for liquidity provision for the AMM
protocol. To our best knowledge, there are no known protocol or literature that
are proposing similar deep learning-augmented AMM that achieves similar capital
efficiency and loss minimization objectives for practical real-world
applications."
