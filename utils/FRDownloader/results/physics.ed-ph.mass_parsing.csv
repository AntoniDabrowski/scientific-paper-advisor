profession is an important and complex endeavor. Teacher education systems must
provide a structure for the coherent professional development of prospective
teachers. Worldwide, physics teacher education is organized in different ways,
but have to face similar challenges, like the relation between academic studies
and practical preparation. To meet these challenges, it is worth taking look at
different teacher education systems. In this chapter, we compare physics
teacher education in two countries, representing two different educational
traditions: Germany and the USA. Comparing different aspects of physics teacher
education (standards, organization and institutionalization, content of teacher
education, quality assurance), we describe both systems in their current state
and why they are organized in the way they are. In doing so, we identify
surprising commonalities but also different opportunities for both systems to

efficacy factor. The instrument has been tested for reliability and construct

established by computing one way analyses of variances, with the p value
suitably protected, using independent variables peripherally related to the

recent years. Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online,
e.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging
task for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the
explaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has
uncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views
or likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos' explaining
quality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be
statistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality. To date,
these findings have only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on
classical mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations
between the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for
videos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for
example from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study
analyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on quantum
entanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a category-based
measure of explanatory videos' explaining quality from the literature. We
report correlations between the videos' explaining quality, and the surface
features provided by YouTube. On the one hand, our results substantiate earlier
findings for mechanics topics. On other hand, partial correlations shed new
light on the relationship between YouTube's surface features and explaining
quality of explanatory videos."

quantum concepts of quantum 2.0 technology, framing quantum science and
technology as spooky and enigmatic, framing quantum technology narrowly in
terms of public good and having a strong focus on quantum computing. To date,
no research has yet assessed whether these potential issues are actually
present in popular communication about quantum science. In this content
analysis, we have examined the presence of these potential issues in 501 TEDx
talks with quantum science and technology content. Results show that while most
experts (70%) explained at least one underlying quantum concept (superposition,
entanglement or contextuality) of quantum 2.0 technology, only 28% of the
non-experts did so. Secondly, the spooky/enigmatic frame was present in about a
quarter of the talks. Thirdly, a narrow public good frame was found,
predominantly by highlighting the benefits of quantum science and technology
(found in over 6 times more talks than risks). Finally, the main focus was on
quantum computing at the expense of other quantum technologies. In conclusion,
the proposed frames are indeed found in TEDx talks, there is indeed a focus on
quantum computing, but at least experts explain underlying quantum concepts
often."
