much attention in the literature. The two most widely used conditional

a new method to introduce targeting in both models to estimate matrices
associated with financial time series. Our approach is based on specific groups
of highly correlated assets in a financial market, and these relationships
remain unaltered over time. Based on the estimated parameters, we evaluate our
targeting method on simulated series by referring to two well-known loss
functions introduced in the literature and Network analysis. We find all the
maximal cliques in correlation graphs to evaluate the effectiveness of our
method. Results from an empirical case study are encouraging, mainly when the
number of assets is not large."

experiments are needed.","On the one hand, one can

the MACD applied to stocks listed on US stocks market indices becomes critical.","Or is

their own trading. Evaluating the effectiveness of technical analysis has
become more feasible due to increasing computing capability and blooming public
data, which indie investors can perform stock analysis and backtest their own
trading strategy conveniently. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
indicator is one of the popular technical indicators that are widely used in
different strategies. In order to verify the MACD effectiveness, in this
thesis, I use the MACD indicator with traditional parameters (12, 26, 9) to
build various trading strategies. Then, I apply these strategies to stocks
listed on three indices in the US stock market (i.e., Dow-Jones, Nasdaq, and
S&P 500) and evaluate its performance in terms of win rate, profitability,
Sharpe ratio, number of trades and maximum drawdown. The backtesting is
programmed using Python, covering the period between 01/01/2015 and 28-08-2021.
The result shows that the win-rate of the strategy with only the MACD indicator
is less than 50%. However, the win-rate is improved for the trading strategies
that combine the MACD indicator with other momentum indicators like the Money
Flow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Based on this result, I
redesign the MACD mathematical formula by taking the trading volume and daily
price volatility into consideration to derive a new indicator called VPVMA. The
results show that the win-rate and risk-adjust performance of this new trading
strategy have been improved significantly. In general, the findings suggest
that while all the MACD trading strategies mentioned above can generate
positive returns, the performance is not good without using other momentum
indicators. Hence, the VPVMA indicator performs better."

constraints via dynamic programming in a setting of incomplete markets due to
stochastic volatility. We demonstrate that the value function in the
constrained problem can be represented as an expected modified utility of a
vega-neutral financial derivative on the optimal unconstrained wealth. The
optimal wealth and the optimal investment strategy in the constrained problem
follow similarly. The case of a power utility and a Value-at-Risk constraint is
treated theoretically in details. In numerical studies, we substantiate the
impact of risk aversion levels, and investment horizons on the optimal
investment strategy. We find a 20% relative difference between constrained and
unconstrained allocations for average parameters in a low risk-aversion,
short-horizon setting."
