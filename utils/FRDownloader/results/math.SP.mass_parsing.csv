$H_a=[a(i+j)]_{i,j\geq0}$. Similarly, for any $d\geq2$, a $d$-variable Hankel
matrix is defined as $H_{\mathbf{a}}=[\mathbf{a}(\mathbf{i}+\mathbf{j})]$,
where $\mathbf{i}=(i_1,\dots,i_d)$ and $\mathbf{j}=(j_1,\dots,j_d)$, with
$i_1,\dots,i_d,j_1,\dots,j_d\geq0$. For $\gamma>0$, A. Pushnitski and D. Yafaev
proved that the eigenvalues of the compact one-variable Hankel matrices $H_a$
with $a(j)=j^{-1}(\log j)^{-\gamma}$, for $j\geq2$, obey the asymptotics
$\lambda_n(H_a)\sim C_\gamma n^{-\gamma}$, as $n\to+\infty$, where the constant
$C_\gamma$ is calculated explicitly. This paper presents the following
$d$-variable analogue. Let $\gamma>0$ and $a(j)=j^{-d}(\log j)^{-\gamma}$, for
$j\geq2$. If $\mathbf{a}(j_1,\dots,j_d)=a(j_1+\dots+j_d)$, then
$H_{\mathbf{a}}$ is compact and its eigenvalues follow the asymptotics
$\lambda_n(H_{\mathbf{a}})\sim C_{d,\gamma}n^{-\gamma}$, as $n\to+\infty$,
where the constant $C_{d,\gamma}$ is calculated explicitly."

elliptic potentials for the non-self-adjoint Dirac operator, which connects two
previously known limiting cases in which the elliptic parameter is zero or one.
A full characterization of the spectrum of the Dirac operator is obtained by
relating the periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalue problems for the Dirac
operator to corresponding tridiagonal operators acting on Fourier coefficients
in a weighted Hilbert space, and to appropriate connection problems for Heun's
equation. In turn, these problems are related to eigenvalue problems for four
non-self-adjoint unbounded tridiagonal operators, all of which nonetheless have
real eigenvalues."

delay on geometrical graphs that involves {\it global} delay parameter.
Differential operators on graphs model various processes in many areas of
science and technology. Although a vast majority of studies in this direction
concern purely differential operators on graphs (often referred to as quantum
graphs), recently there also appeared some considerations of nonlocal operators
on star-type graphs. In particular, there belong functional-differential
operators with constant delays but in a {\it locally} nonlocal version. The
latter means that each edge of the graph has its own delay parameter, which
does not affect any other edge. In this paper, we introduce {\it globally}
nonlocal operators that are expected to be more natural for modelling nonlocal
processes on graphs. We also extend this idea to arbitrary trees, which opens a
wide area of further research. Another goal of the paper is to study inverse
spectral problems for operators with global delay in one illustrative case by
addressing a wide range of questions including uniqueness, characterization of
the spectral data as well as the uniform stability."
