bridges (cycles) of various lengths with interactions between any pair of legs
of the cycles. It is one of the standard mathematical models in which a proof
for the famous Bose-Einstein condensation phase transition is sought for. We
introduce a simplified version of the model with an organisation of the
particles in deterministic boxes instead of Brownian cycles as the marks of a
reference Poisson point process (for simplicity, in $\mathbb Z^d$ instead of
$\mathbb R^d$).
  We derive an explicit and interpretable variational formula in the
thermodynamic limit for the limiting free energy of the canonical ensemble for
any value of the particle density. This formula features all relevant physical
quantities of the model, like the microscopic and the macroscopic particle
densities, together with their mutual and self-energies and their entropies.
The proof method comprises a two-step large-deviation approach for marked
Poisson point processes and an explicit distinction into small and large marks.
  In the characteristic formula, each of the microscopic particles and the
statistics of the macroscopic part of the configuration are seen explicitly;
the latter receives the interpretation of the condensate. The formula enables
us to prove a number of properties of the limiting free energy as a function of
the particle density, like differentiability and explicit upper and lower
bounds, and a qualitative picture below and above the critical threshold (if it
is finite). This proves a modified saturation nature of the phase transition.

transition."

the convergence to zero in probability of the remainder are well balanced. The
main novelty of our method to balance the convergence lies in proposing an

CTRW with non-exponential waiting times. If we make the diffusion coefficient
responsible for the size of jumps and take waiting times from the domain of

standard scaling would lead in the limit of small jumps and large intensities

the corresponding fractional equations for the cases of multidimensional

Let us mention that the MY property and related characterization triggered a lot of further research developing
in several directions: (1) more general algebraic structures as, a multivariate tree-generated version in Massam
and Wesołowski (2004), matrix variate versions in Letac and Wesołowski (2000), Wesołowski (2002), Massam
and Wesołowski (2006), a combination of the matrix variate and multivariate tree-generated setting in Bobecka
(2015), symmetric cone variate in Kołodziejek (2017), a version in free probability in Szpojankowski (2017);
(2) characterizations based on a weaker assumption of constancy of regressions of moments of T given S
instead of the assumption of independence of S and T - in univariate case in Wesołowski (2002), Chou and
Wang (2004) and in free probability in Szpojankowski (2017) and S´ wieca (2021); (3) a search of more general
maps of the form ψf (a, b) = (f (a + b), f (a) − f (a + b)) and product measures µ ⊗ ν, such that ψf (µ ⊗ ν)
remains a product measure and characterization of respective µ and ν by the independence property in Koudou
and Vallois (2012) with a genuine special case of µ and ν being the Kummer and gamma distributions, see also
Koudou and Vallois (2011), Koudou (2011), Wesołowski (2015), Piliszek and Wesołowski (2016), Kołodziejek

Essentially, this has already been proved in Bao and Noack (2021) with
supplementary hypothesis on existence of smooth densities.
  The sources of these questions are an observation about independence
properties of the exponential Brownian motion due to Matsumoto and Yor (2001)

rooted in the discrete Korteweg - de Vries equation, where the above result was
conjectured.
  We also extend the direct result to random matrices proving that a matrix
variate analogue of the above independence property is satisfied by independent

matrices through this independence property remains open."

aforementioned growth condition the phase transition for survival coincides
with the phase transition of non-triviality of the upper invariant law.
Furthermore, we prove continuity properties for the survival probability and
derive equivalent conditions for complete convergence, in an analogous way as
for the classical contact process. We then focus on the special case, where the
evolving random environment is described through a dynamical percolation. We
show that the contact process on a dynamical percolation on the $d$-dimensional
integer dies out a.s. at criticality and complete convergence holds for all
parameter choices. In the end we derive some comparison results between a
dynamical percolation and ergodic spin systems with finite range such that we

freeness of type $B$. As byproducts, we recover the asymptotic cyclic

Markovian or non-Markovian. Under the majority rule, in each round, each agent
simultaneously updates his/her opinion according to the majority of his/her
neighbors. Our network has a community structure and randomly evolves with
time. In contrast to the classic setting, the dynamics is not purely
deterministic, and reflects the structure of SBM by resampling the connections
at each step, making agents with the same opinion more likely to connect than
those with different opinions.
  In the \emph{Markovian model}, connections between agents are resampled at
each step according to the SBM law and each agent updates his/her opinion via
the majority rule. We prove a \emph{power-of-one} type result, i.e., any
initial bias leads to a non-trivial advantage of winning in the end, uniformly
in the size of the network.
  In the \emph{non-Markovian model}, a connection between two agents is
resampled according to the SBM law only when some of the two changes opinion

convergence to the consensus and a halt of the dynamics. Moreover, we establish

antiderivative of $b_{n-1}(x)$ subject to $\int_0^1 b_n(x) dx = 0$. We offer a
related characterization: $b_1(x) = x - 1/2$ and $(-1)^{n-1} b_n(x)$ for $n >0$

part of a sum of $n$ independent random variables, each with the beta$(1,2)$
probability density $2(1-x)$ at $x \in (0,1)$. This result has a novel
combinatorial analog, the {\em Bernoulli clock}: mark the hours of a $2 n$ hour
clock by a uniform random permutation of the multiset $\{1,1, 2,2, \ldots,
n,n\}$, meaning pick two different hours uniformly at random from the $2 n$
hours and mark them $1$, then pick two different hours uniformly at random from
the remaining $2 n - 2$ hours and mark them $2$, and so on. Starting from hour
$0 = 2n$, move clockwise to the first hour marked $1$, continue clockwise to
the first hour marked $2$, and so on, continuing clockwise around the Bernoulli
clock until the first of the two hours marked $n$ is encountered, at a random
hour $I_n$ between $1$ and $2n$. We show that for each positive integer $n$,
the event $( I_n = 1)$ has probability $(1 - 2^n b_n(0))/(2n)$, where $n!
b_n(0) = B_n(0)$ is the $n$th Bernoulli number. For $ 1 \le k \le 2 n$, the
difference $\delta_n(k):= 1/(2n) - \P( I_n = k)$ is a polynomial function of
$k$ with the surprising symmetry $\delta_n( 2 n + 1 - k) = (-1)^n \delta_n(k)$,

polynomials $b_n(1-x) = (-1)^n b_n(x)$."

numerical integration methods that run under various names such as quadrature,
cubature, or recombination. A natural approach is to sample points from $\mu$

vectors: from the general framework of multivariate regular variation and the
flexible class of max-stable vectors down to simple and concise summary
measures like the matrix of bivariate tail-dependence coefficients. This paper
starts by providing a review of existing results from a unifying perspective,
which highlights connections between extreme value theory and the theory of
cuts and metrics. Our approach leads to some new findings in both areas with
some applications to current topics in risk management.
  We begin by using the framework of multivariate regular variation to show
that extremal coefficients, or equivalently, the higher-order tail-dependence
coefficients of a random vector can simply be understood in terms of random
exceedance sets, which allows us to extend the notion of Bernoulli
compatibility. In the special but important case of bi-variate tail-dependence,
we establish a correspondence between tail-dependence matrices and $L^1$- and
$\ell_1$-embeddable finite metric spaces via the spectral distance, which is a
metric on the space of jointly $1$-Fr\'{e}chet random variables. Namely, the
coefficients of the cut-decomposition of the spectral distance and of the
Tawn-Molchanov max-stable model realizing the corresponding bi-variate extremal
dependence coincide. We show that line metrics are rigid and if the spectral
distance corresponds to a line metric, the higher order tail-dependence is
determined by the bi-variate tail-dependence matrix.
  Finally, the correspondence between $\ell_1$-embeddable metric spaces and
tail-dependence matrices allows us to revisit the realizability problem, i.e.
checking whether a given matrix is a valid tail-dependence matrix. We confirm a
conjecture of Shyamalkumar & Tao (2020) that this problem is NP-complete."

Glatt-Holtz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Vincent R. Martinez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hung D. Nguyen')]","We study a class of semi-linear differential Volterra equations with
polynomial-type potentials that incorporates the effects of memory while being
subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. We show that
for a broad class of non-linear potentials and sufficiently regular noise the
system always admits invariant probability measures, defined on the extended
phase space, that possess higher regularity properties dictated by the
structure of the nonlinearities in the equation. Furthermore, we investigate
the singular limit as the memory kernel collapses to a Dirac function.
Specifically, provided sufficiently many directions in the phase space are
stochastically forced, we show that there is a unique stationary measure to
which the system converges, in a suitable Wasserstein distance, at exponential
rates independent of the decay of the memory kernel. We then prove the
convergence of the statistically steady states to the unique invariant
probability of the classical stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the
desired singular limit. As a consequence, we establish the validity of the
small memory approximation for solutions on the infinite time horizon
$[0,\infty)$."

[28] and present a large new class of examples. Our notion of nonlinear Markov
property is in McKean's spirit, but, in fact, more general in order to include
examples of such processes whose one-dimensional time marginals solve a
nonlinear parabolic PDE (more precisely, a nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov
equation) such as Burgers' equation, the porous media equation, or variants of
the latter with transport-type drift. We show that the associated nonlinear
Markov process is given by path laws of weak solutions to a corresponding
distribution-dependent stochastic differential equation whose coefficients
depend singularly (i.e. Nemytskii-type) on its one-dimensional time marginals.
Moreover, we show that also for general nonlinear Markov processes, their path
laws are uniquely determined by one-dimensional time marginals of suitable
associated conditional path laws."
