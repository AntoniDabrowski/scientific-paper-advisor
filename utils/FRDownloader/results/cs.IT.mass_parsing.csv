are expected to meet requirements of different applications. However, for
applications of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) such as URLLC, the transmission latency
is required to be much shorter than that in eMBB. Therefore, the resulting
channel code length reduces drastically. In this case, the traditional 1-D
channel coding suffers a lot from the performance degradation and fails to
deliver strong reliability with very low latency. To remove this bottleneck,
new channel coding scheme beyond the existing 1-D one is in urgent need. By
making full use of the spacial freedom of massive MIMO systems, this paper
devotes itself in proposing a spatiotemporal 2-D channel coding for very low
latency reliable transmission. For a very short time-domain code length
$N^{\text{time}}=16$, $64 \times 128$ MIMO system employing the proposed
spatiotemporal 2-D coding scheme successfully shows more than $3$\,dB
performance gain at $\text{FER}=10^{-3}$, compared to the 1-D time-domain
channel coding. It is noted that the proposed coding scheme is suitable for
different channel codes and enjoys high flexibility to adapt to difference
scenarios. By appropriately selecting the code rate, code length, and the
number of codewords in the time and space domains, the proposed coding scheme
can achieve a good trade-off between the transmission latency and reliability."

a decoder capable of correcting up to t errors. The second is based on the
Reed-Solomon codes and Guruswami-Sudan list decoding algorithm. The first
scheme provides an energy efficiency very close to the random coding bound when
the decoding complexity is unbounded. But for the practical parameters, the
second scheme is better and improves the performance of a tree code-based

system, where a ground node (GN) communicate with a UAV assisted by intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) in the presence of a jammer with imperfect location
information. We aim to improve the achievable average rate via the joint robust
design of UAV trajectory, IRS passive beamforming and GN's power allocation.
However, the formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve due to its
non-convexity and coupled variables. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an
alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by
leveraging semidefinite relaxation (SDR), successive convex approximation
(SCA), and S-procedure methods. Simulation results show that by deploying the
IRS near the GN, our proposed algorithm always improves the uplink achievable
average rate significantly compared with the benchmark algorithms, while
deploying the IRS nearby the jammer is effective only when the jammer's

on hierarchical partitions of a metric space, previously proposed by Asadi et
al., we propose a stochastic chaining approach, which replaces the hierarchical
partitions with an abstracted Markovian model borrowed from successive
refinement source coding. This approach has three benefits over deterministic
chaining: 1) the metric space is not necessarily bounded, 2) facilitation of
subsequent analysis to yield more explicit bound, and 3) further opportunity to
optimize the bound by removing the geometric rigidity of the partitions. The
proposed approach includes the traditional chaining as a special case, and can
therefore also utilize any deterministic chaining construction. We illustrate
these benefits using the problem of estimating Gaussian mean and that of phase
retrieval. For the former, we derive a bound that provides an order-wise
improvement over previous results, and for the latter we provide a stochastic
chain that allows optimization over the chaining parameter."

gradient calculations among $n$ workers. By assigning tasks to all the workers

algorithm's error with its runtime by gradually increasing $k$ as the algorithm
evolves. However, this strategy, referred to as adaptive $k$-sync, neglects the
cost of unused computations and of communicating models to workers that reveal
a straggling behavior. We propose a cost-efficient scheme that assigns tasks
only to $k$ workers, and gradually increases $k$. We introduce the use of a
combinatorial multi-armed bandit model to learn which workers are the fastest
while assigning gradient calculations. Assuming workers with exponentially
distributed response times parameterized by different means, we give empirical
and theoretical guarantees on the regret of our strategy, i.e., the extra time
spent to learn the mean response times of the workers. Furthermore, we propose
and analyze a strategy applicable to a large class of response time
distributions. Compared to adaptive $k$-sync, our scheme achieves significantly
lower errors with the same computational efforts and less downlink

multi-user communications, where an RIS is used to assist the base station (BS)
for serving multiple users. The RIS consisting of passive reflecting elements
can manipulate the reflected direction of the incoming electromagnetic waves by
adjusting the phase shifts of the reflecting elements. Alternating optimization
(AO) based approach is commonly used to determine the phase shifts of the RIS
elements. While AO-based approaches have shown significant gain of RIS, the
complexity is quite high due to the coupled structure of the cascade channel
from the BS through RIS to the user. In addition, the sub-wavelength structure
of the RIS introduces spatial correlation that may cause strong interference to
users. To handle severe multi-user interference over correlated channels, we
consider adaptive user grouping previously proposed for massive mutli-input and
multi-output (MIMO) systems and propose two low-complexity beamforming design
methods, depending on whether the grouping result is taken into account.
Simulation results demonstrate the superior sum rate achieved by the proposed
methods than that without user grouping. Besides, the proposed methods can
perform similarly to the AO-based approach but with much lower complexity."

equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) for these models increases linearly
with the number of models. In this paper, we propose a DL-based changeable-rate

feasibility of CSI feedback systems. This framework can reutilize all the
network layers to achieve overhead-changeable CSI feedback to optimize the
storage efficiency at the UE and the BS sides. Designed quantizer in this
framework can avoid the normalization and gradient problems faced by
traditional quantization schemes. Specifically, we propose two DL-based
changeable-rate CSI feedback networks CH-CsiNetPro and CH-DualNetSph by
introducing a feedback overhead control unit. Then, a pluggable quantization
block (PQB) is developed to further improve the encoding efficiency of CSI
feedback in an end-to-end way. Compared with existing CSI feedback methods, the

cooperation and the practical effect of DFO on system performance, exact

larger and more uniform SE than the other systems. Finally, the train antenna

The good codes possess
large information length and large minimum distance. A class of codes is said
to be asymptotically good if there exists a positive real $\delta$ such that,
for any positive integer $N$ we can find a code in the class with code length
greater than $N$, and with both the rate and the relative minimum distance
greater than $\delta$. The linear codes over any finite field are
asymptotically good. More interestingly, the (asymptotic) GV-bound is a phase
transition point for the linear codes; i.e., asymptotically speaking, the
parameters of most linear codes attain the GV-bound. It is a long-standing open
question: whether or not the cyclic codes over a finite field (which are an
important class of codes) are asymptotically good? However, from a long time
ago the quasi-cyclic codes of index $2$ were proved to be asymptotically good.
This chapter consists of some of our studies on the asymptotic properties of
several classes of quasi-group codes. We'll explain the studies in a consistent
and self-contained style. We begin with the classical results on linear codes.
In many cases we consider the quasi-group codes over finite abelian groups
(including the cyclic case as a subcase of course), and study their asymptotic
properties along two directions: (1) the order of the group (the coindex) is
fixed while the index is going to infinity; (2) the index is small while the
order of the group (the coindex) is going to infinity. Finally we describe the
story on dihedral codes. The dihedral groups are non-abelian but near to cyclic
groups (they have cyclic subgroups of index $2$). The asymptotic goodness of
binary dihedral codes was obtained in the beginning of this century, and
extended to the general dihedral codes recently."

mMTC uplink framework is proposed to jointly identify the received signal's
sparsity and the active MTDs in the absence of channel state information. The
proposed scheme learns the correlation between the received signal and the
multi-dimensional codebook for SCMA and spreading sequences for MUSA schemes
and is able to identify the active MTDs from the received signal without any
prior knowledge of the device sparsity level. The application of the proposed
MUD scheme is further investigated in an indoor factory setting using four

rate over the total power consumption is converted into a non-fractional form

studies are considered: two point-to-point (closed-loop and open-loop MIMO) and
two MU scenarios (MIMO broadcast and interference channels). For the
point-to-point scenarios, we explain some of the performance gains observed in
prior work through the selection of improved baseline schemes that include
geometric shaping as well as bit and power allocation. For the MIMO broadcast
channel, we demonstrate the feasibility of a novel AE method with centralized
learning and decentralized execution. Interestingly, the learned scheme
performs close to nonlinear vector-perturbation precoding and significantly
outperforms conventional zero-forcing. Lastly, we highlight potential pitfalls
when interpreting learned communication schemes. In particular, we show that
the AE for the considered interference channel learns to avoid interference,
albeit in a rotated reference frame. After de-rotating the learned signal
constellation of each user, the resulting scheme corresponds to conventional
time sharing with geometric shaping."

Shannon by aiming to transmit the meaning of a message rather than its exact
copy and thus potentially allows for savings in bandwidth.
  In this work, inspired by Weaver, we propose an information-theoretic
framework where the semantic context is explicitly introduced into
probabilistic models. In particular, for bandwidth efficient transmission, we
define semantic communication system design as an Information Bottleneck
optimization problem and consider important implementation aspects. Further, we
uncover the restrictions of the classic 5G communication system design w.r.t.

(MUD) are appealing for solving the random access problem in massive
machine-type communications (mMTC) with sporadic device activity. Such
protocols would greatly benefit from a prior deterministic knowledge of the
sparsity level, i.e., instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices
$K$. Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated
pilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the
transmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading.
CPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink
transmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel
state information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss
two specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based
phase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control
used by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse
power control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if
their corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level
detector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer
detection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous
real domain followed by a rounding operation. We show that the variance of the
relaxed estimator increases with $K^2$ and $K$ when operating with U-CPT and
A-CPT mechanisms, respectively. The distribution of the estimators under U-CPT,
A-CPT-F and A-CPT-D is found to follow an exponential, Gaussian, and Student's
$t-$like distribution, respectively. Analyses evince the superiority of
A-CPT-D, which is also corroborated via numerical results. We reveal several

of the emerging semantic transmission and the conventional bit-based
transmission in future networks. The semantic rate is considered for measuring
the performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge is that
there is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the
semantic similarity, which characterizes the sentence similarity between an
original sentence and the corresponding recovered sentence. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a data regression method, where the semantic similarity
is approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained
tractable function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication
framework, where an access point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit
streams to one semantics-interested user (S-user) and one bit-interested user
(B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission in
multi-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple
access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More
specifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA is split into two streams, one is
transmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency sub-band and the
other is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study
the fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the
semantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An
optimal resource allocation procedure is then derived for characterizing the
boundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved by each MA
scheme. The structures of the derived solutions demonstrate that semi-NOMA is
superior to both NOMA and OMA given its highly flexible transmission policy.
Our numerical results validate the analysis and show the superiority of
semi-NOMA."

MIMO (XL-MIMO) in 6G networks with ultra-high spectral efficiency.
Unfortunately, most of the existing channel estimation methods designed for
XL-MIMO fail to consider a double-side near-field scenario, where both
transmitter and receiver are equipped with extremely large-scale antenna
arrays. The existing channel estimation schemes cannot be directly applied to
the double-side near-field scenario. In this paper, based on this scenario, we
first derive double-side near-field Rayleigh distance (DS-RD) and effective
double-side near-field Rayleigh distance (EDS-RD) to determine the range of the
double-side near-field region. Then, a double-side near-field channel model is
proposed to match this scenario, where the distance of the transmitter from the
receiver is smaller than EDS-RD. In the proposed channel model, the line of
sight (LoS) path component is modeled by the geometric free assumption while
non-line of sight (NLoS) path components are modeled by the near-field array
response vectors. Finally, a double-side near-field channel estimation
algorithm is proposed to solve the channel estimation problem in this scenario,
where the LoS path component and NLoS path components are estimated separately.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed channel estimation
algorithm is able to outperform the existing methods."

with providing a complete framework for model-known cases. Then, we bring to

optimizing over model spaces, which build a bridge between the accuracy of

the three bands is helpful for maximizing the number of flows with their QoS
requirements satisfied. To solve the formulated nonlinear integer programming
problem, we propose a triple-band scheduling scheme which can select the
optimum scheduling band for each flow among three different frequency bands.

\underline{c}lustering for \underline{d}ecentralized aggregation (FL-EOCD). The
introduced FL-EOCD leverages device-to-device (D2D) communications and
overlapped clustering to enable decentralized aggregation, where a cluster is
defined as a coverage zone of a typical device. The devices located on the
overlapped clusters are called bridge devices (BDs). In the proposed FL-EOCD
scheme, a clustering topology is envisioned where clusters are connected
through BDs, so as the aggregated models of each cluster is disseminated to the
other clusters in a decentralized manner without the need for a global
aggregator or an additional hop of transmission. Unlike the star-based FL, the
proposed FL-EOCD scheme involves a large number of local devices by reusing the
RRBs in different non-adjacent clusters. To evaluate our proposed FL-EOCD
scheme as opposed to baseline FL schemes, we consider minimizing the overall
energy-consumption of devices while maintaining the convergence rate of FL
subject to its time constraint. To this end, a joint optimization problem,
considering scheduling the local devices/BDs to the CHs and computation
frequency allocation, is formulated, where an iterative solution to this joint
problem is devised. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FL-EOCD algorithm over FL conventional schemes in
terms of energy consumption, latency, and convergence rate."

data. Neuromorphic chips, when coupled with spike-based sensors, can inherently
adapt to the ""semantics"" of the data distribution by consuming energy only when
relevant events are recorded in the timing of spikes and by proving a
low-latency response to changing conditions in the environment. This paper
proposes an end-to-end design for a neuromorphic wireless Internet-of-Things
system that integrates spike-based sensing, processing, and communication. In
the proposed NeuroComm system, each sensing device is equipped with a
neuromorphic sensor, a spiking neural network (SNN), and an impulse radio
transmitter with multiple antennas. Transmission takes place over a shared
fading channel to a receiver equipped with a multi-antenna impulse radio
receiver and with an SNN. In order to enable adaptation of the receiver to the
fading channel conditions, we introduce a hypernetwork to control the weights
of the decoding SNN using pilots. Pilots, encoding SNNs, decoding SNN, and
hypernetwork are jointly trained across multiple channel realizations. The
proposed system is shown to significantly improve over conventional frame-based
digital solutions, as well as over alternative non-adaptive training methods,
in terms of time-to-accuracy and energy consumption metrics."

colorings for m + 1 = D(2T ) , where W -constraint is one of graceful, harmonious, (odd-edge) edge-

algorithms including the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm and the weighted minimum
mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm failed to achieve a satisfactory trade-off
between complexity and performance. In this paper, leveraging on the power of
deep learning, we propose a low-complexity precoding design framework for
MU-MIMO systems. The key idea is to transform the MIMO precoding problem into
the multiple-input single-output precoding problem, where the optimal precoding
structure can be obtained in closed-form. A customized deep neural network is
designed to fit the mapping from the channels to the precoding matrix. In
addition, the technique of input dimensionality reduction, network pruning, and
recovery module compression are used to further improve the computational
efficiency. Furthermore, the extension to the practical MIMO orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system is studied. Simulation
results show that the proposed low-complexity precoding scheme achieves similar
performance as the WMMSE algorithm with very low computational complexity."

sensing mainly focus on mutually exclusive task allocation and independent data
transmission, which did not fully exploit the benefit of multi-UAV sensing and
communication. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-UAV cooperative S&T
scheme with replicated sensing task allocation. Although replicated task
allocation may sound counter-intuitive, it can actually foster cooperative
transmission among multiple UAVs and thus reduce the overall sensing mission
completion time. To obtain the optimal task allocation and transmit power of
the proposed scheme, a mission completion time minimization problem is
formulated. To solve this problem, a necessary condition for replicated sensing
task allocation is derived. For the cases of replicated sensing, the considered
problem is transformed into a monotonic optimization and is solved by the
generic Polyblock algorithm. To efficiently evaluate the mission completion
time in each iteration of the Polyblock algorithm, new auxiliary variables are
introduced to decouple the otherwise sophisticated joint optimization of
transmission time and power. While for the degenerated case of non-replicated
sensing, the closed-form expression of the optimal transmission time is derived"

enhance the physical layer security of an integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system in which the IRS is deployed to not only assist the downlink
communication for multiple users, but also create a virtual line-of-sight (LoS)
link for target sensing. In particular, we consider a challenging scenario
where the target may be a suspicious eavesdropper that potentially intercepts
the communication-user information transmitted by the base station (BS). We
investigate the joint design of the phase shifts at the IRS and the
communication as well as radar beamformers at the BS to maximize the sensing
beampattern gain towards the target, subject to the maximum information leakage
to the eavesdropping target and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) required by users. Based on the availability of perfect channel
state information (CSI) of all involved user links and the accurate target
location at the BS, two scenarios are considered and two different optimization
algorithms are proposed. For the ideal scenario where the CSI of the user links
and the target location are perfectly known at the BS, a penalty-based
algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution. In particular, the
beamformers are obtained with a semi-closed-form solution using Lagrange
duality and the IRS phase shifts are solved for in closed form by applying the
majorization-minimization (MM) method. On the other hand, for the more
practical scenario where the CSI is imperfect and the target location is
uncertain, a robust algorithm based on the $\cal S$-procedure and
sign-definiteness approaches is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving a trade-off between the

mobile communication systems, which, unfortunately, leads to severe cell-edge

antenna arrays employed at BSs, the beamspace channel is sparse for each user,
and thus there is no need to serve all the users in a cell by all the beams
therein jointly. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop a flexible
clustered cell-free networking scheme that can decompose the whole network into
a number of weakly interfered small subnetworks operating independently and in
parallel. Given a per-user rate constraint for service quality guarantee, this
paper aims to maximize the number of decomposed subnetworks so as to reduce the
signaling overhead and system complexity as much as possible. By formulating it
as a bipartite graph partitioning problem, a rate-constrained network
decomposition (RC-NetDecomp) algorithm is proposed, which can smoothly tune the
network structure from the current cellular network with simple beam allocation
to a fully cooperative network by increasing the required per-user rate.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC-NetDecomp algorithm
outperforms existing baselines in terms of average per-user rate, fairness

consistent modeling approach for far-field (FF) MIMO communication based on
multi-port circuit theory. In doing so, we turn mutual coupling (MC) from a foe
to a friend of MIMO systems design, thereby challenging a basic percept in
antenna systems engineering that promotes MC mitigation/compensation. We show
that tight MC widens the operational bandwidth of antenna arrays thereby
unleashing a missing MIMO gain that we coin ""bandwidth gain"". Furthermore, we
derive analytically the asymptotically optimum spacing-to-antenna-size ratio by
establishing a condition for tight coupling in the limit of large-size antenna
arrays with quasi-continuous apertures. We also optimize the antenna array size
while maximizing the achievable rate under fixed transmit power and
inter-element spacing. Then, we study the impact of MC on the achievable rate

generalizes centralized MMSE precoding to distributed operations based on

precoding assumes network-wide sharing of the data bearing signals, and hence
it is inherently not scalable. In this work, inspired by recent advances on
scalable cell-free architectures based on user-centric network clustering
techniques, we address this issue by proposing a novel version of the TMMSE
precoding design covering partial message sharing. The obtained framework is
then successfully applied to derive a variety of novel, optimal, and efficient
precoding schemes for a user-centric cell-free network deployed using multiple
radio stripes. Numerical simulations of a typical industrial internet-of-things

Huh solved several long-standing open problems on
log-concave sequences in combinatorics. The ground-breaking techniques
developed in those work are from algebraic geometry: ""We believe that behind
any log-concave sequence that appears in nature there is such a Hodge structure
responsible for the log-concavity"".
  A function is called completely monotone if its derivatives alternate in
signs; e.g., $e^{-t}$. A fundamental conjecture in mathematical physics and
Shannon information theory is on the complete monotonicity of Gaussian
distribution (GCMC), which states that $I(X+Z_t)$\footnote{The probability
density function of $X+Z_t$ is called ""heat flow"" in mathematical physics.} is
completely monotone in $t$, where $I$ is Fisher information, random variables
$X$ and $Z_t$ are independent and $Z_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,t)$ is Gaussian.
  Inspired by the algebraic geometry method introduced by J. Huh, GCMC is
reformulated in the form of a log-convex sequence. In general, a completely
monotone function can admit a log-convex sequence and a log-convex sequence can
further induce a log-concave sequence. The new formulation may guide GCMC to
the marvelous temple of algebraic geometry. Moreover, to make GCMC more
accessible to researchers from both information theory and
mathematics\footnote{The author was not familiar with algebraic geometry. The
paper is also aimed at providing people outside information theory of necessary
background on the history of GCMC in theory and application.}, together with
some new findings, a thorough summary of the origin, the implication and
further study on GCMC is presented."

design for covert communication systems from a practical view. Different from
conventional covert communications with equiprobable constellations modulation,
we propose nonequiprobable constellations modulation schemes to further enhance
the covert rate. Specifically, we derive covert rate expressions for practical
discrete constellation inputs for the first time. Then, we study the covert
rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the constellation distribution
and power allocation. In particular, an approximate gradient descent method is
proposed for obtaining the optimal probabilistic constellation shaping. To
strike a balance between the computational complexity and the transmission
performance, we further develop a framework that maximizes a lower bound on the
achievable rate where the optimal probabilistic constellation shaping problem
can be solved efficiently using the Frank-Wolfe method. Extensive numerical
results show that the optimized probabilistic constellation shaping strategies
provide significant gains in the achievable covert rate over the
state-of-the-art schemes."

cell-free massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems, and the
availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is a basic

channel parameters should be calibrated to obtain the downlink CSI due to the
radio frequency circuit mismatch of the transceiver. In this paper, a design of
a reference signal for over-the-air reciprocity calibration is proposed. The
frequency domain generated reference signals can make full use of the flexible
frame structure of the fifth generation (5G) new radio, which can be completely
transparent to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) remote radio units (RRUs) and

an interleaved RRU grouping with a genetic algorithm is proposed, and an

non-convexity and coupled variables. To overcome the difficulty, we propose an
alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it sub-optimally by
leveraging Dinkelbach's algorithm, successive convex approximation (SCA)
technique, and block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Extensive simulation
results show that the proposed design can significantly improve the
anti-jamming performance. In particular, for the remote jammer case, the
proposed design can largely shorten the flight path and thus decrease the
energy consumption via the signal enhancement; while for the local jammer case,
which is deemed highly challenging in conventional systems without IRS since
the retreating away strategy becomes ineffective, our proposed design even
achieves a higher performance gain owing to the efficient jamming signal
mitigation."

of reconstructing a string from part of its composition multiset. We give a
full description of the structure of the strings that cannot be uniquely

prefix-suffix compositions. Leveraging this description, we prove that for all
$n\ge 6$, there exists a string of length $n$ that cannot be uniquely
reconstructed up to reversal. Moreover, for all $n\ge 6$, we explicitly
construct the set consisting of all length $n$ strings that can be uniquely

conveying the meaning of information becomes important, which requires some

takes an action to send a signal that conveys information to a receiver, while
the receiver can interpret the signal and choose a response accordingly. Based

certain type property, and (ii) partitioning (most of) the list into subsets of
codewords that satisfy a certain pairwise-symmetry property, which facilitates
lower bounding of the average error probability by the pairwise error

in a unified manner which is valid for any rate, as well as for a wide class of

simultaneously harvests energy with a non-linear energy harvesting circuit and
reflects the incident signals by controlling its reflection coefficients and

where a massive number of users' equipment (UEs) try to access an access point

to infer the best RIS configurations that provide opportunistic access to UEs.
The inference is based on a model created during a training phase with a
greatly reduced set of RIS configurations. Specifically, we consider a system
whose operation is divided into three blocks: i) a downlink training block,
which trains the model used by the oracle, ii) an uplink access block, where
the oracle infers the best access slots, and iii) a downlink acknowledgment
block, which provides feedback to the UEs that were successfully decoded by the
AP during access. Numerical results show that the proper integration of the RIS

reached board consensus in both industry and academia for materializing the
vision of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) in the sixth-generation (6G)
era. This gives rise to an emerging research area known as edge intelligence,
which concerns the distillation of human-like intelligence from the huge amount
of data scattered at wireless network edge. In general, realizing edge
intelligence corresponds to the process of sensing, communication, and
computation, which are coupled ingredients for data generation, exchanging, and
processing, respectively. However, conventional wireless networks design the
sensing, communication, and computation separately in a task-agnostic manner,
which encounters difficulties in accommodating the stringent demands of
ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, and high capacity in emerging AI
applications such as auto-driving. This thus prompts a new design paradigm of
seamless integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in a
task-oriented manner, which comprehensively accounts for the use of the data in
the downstream AI applications. In view of its growing interest, this article
provides a timely overview of ISCC for edge intelligence by introducing its

channels and the decoder outputs a list of length $\mathcal{L}$. Moreover, it
is assumed that the transmitted words are chosen from an $e$-error-correcting
code $C \ (\subseteq \{0,1\}^n)$. Previously, when $t = e+\ell$ and the length
$n$ of the transmitted word is large enough, the numbers of required channels
are determined for $\mathcal{L} =1, 2 \text{ and } \ell+1$. Here we determine
the exact number of channels in the cases $\mathcal{L} = 3, 4, \ldots, \ell$.
Furthermore, with the aid of covering codes, we also consider the list sizes in
the cases where the length $n$ is rather small (improving previously known
results). After that we study how much we can decrease the number of required
channels when we use list-decoding codes. Finally, the majority algorithm is
discussed for decoding in a probabilistic set-up; in particular, we show that

multiplexing(OFDM)-based digital over-the-air computation (AirComp) system for
wireless federated edge learning, where multiple edge devices transmit model
data simultaneously using non-orthogonal wireless resources, and the edge
server aggregates data directly from the superimposed signal. Existing analog
AirComp systems often assume perfect phase alignment via channel precoding and
utilize uncoded analog transmission for model aggregation. In contrast, our
digital AirComp system leverages digital modulation and channel codes to
overcome phase asynchrony, thereby achieving accurate model aggregation for
phase-asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems. To realize a digital AirComp
system, we develop a medium access control (MAC) protocol that allows
simultaneous transmissions from different users using non-orthogonal OFDM
subcarriers, and put forth joint channel decoding and aggregation decoders
tailored for convolutional and LDPC codes. To verify the proposed system
design, we build a digital AirComp prototype on the USRP software-defined radio
platform, and demonstrate a real-time LDPC-coded AirComp system with up to four
users. Trace-driven simulation results on test accuracy versus SNR show that:
1) analog AirComp is sensitive to phase asynchrony in practical multi-user OFDM
systems, and the test accuracy performance fails to improve even at high SNRs;
2) our digital AirComp system outperforms two analog AirComp systems at all
SNRs, and approaches the optimal performance when SNR $\geq$ 6 dB for two-user
LDPC-coded AirComp, demonstrating the advantage of digital AirComp in
phase-asynchronous multi-user OFDM systems."

the essential sources of electromagnetic (EM) radiation to the public. Facing
with the swift development of wireless communications, people are skeptical
about the risks of long-term exposure to EM radiation. As EM exposure is
required to be restricted at user terminals, it is inefficient to blindly
decrease the transmit power, which leads to limited spectral efficiency and
energy efficiency (EE). Recently, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has
been proposed as an effective way to provide higher wireless transmission
performance, which is a promising technology for future wireless
communications. To this end, we propose using RSMA to increase the EE of
massive MIMO uplink while limiting the EM exposure of users. In particularly,
we investigate the optimization of the transmit covariance matrices and
decoding order using statistical channel state information (CSI). The problem
is formulated as non-convex mixed integer program, which is in general
difficult to handle. We first propose a modified water-filling scheme to obtain
the transmit covariance matrices with fixed decoding order. Then, a greedy
approach is proposed to obtain the decoding permutation. Numerical results
verify the effectiveness of the proposed EM exposure-aware EE maximization
scheme for uplink RSMA."
