$\overline{m}=(1/3)(2m_l+m_s)$ kept constant to control symmetry breaking
effects. Various sources of systematic uncertainty will be discussed, including
those from continuum extrapolations and extrapolations to the physical point.
We also present new efforts to calculate $f_B$ and $f_{B_s}$ using weighted
averages across multiple time fitting regions. The use of an automated weighted
averaging technique over multiple fitting ranges allows for timely tuning of
the $b$-quark and reduces the impact of systematic errors from fitting range

the leading and subleading LECs of the $O(N)$ large-charge EFT. To alleviate
the signal-to-noise ratio problem present in the large-charge sector of
conventional lattice formulations of the $O(N)$ theory, we employ a recently

may be used to optimize interpolating operator constructions for lattice
quantum field theory (LQFT) calculations on classical computers. Here, two
concrete realizations of the method are developed and implemented. The first
approach is to maximize the overlap, or fidelity, of the state created by an
interpolating operator acting on the vacuum state to the target eigenstate. The
second is to instead minimize the energy expectation value of the interpolated
state. These approaches are implemented in a proof-of-concept calculation in
(1+1)-dimensions for a single-flavor massive Schwinger model to obtain
quantum-optimized interpolating operator constructions for a vector meson state
in the theory. Although fidelity maximization is preferable in the absence of
noise due to quantum gate errors, it is found that energy minimization is more
robust to these effects in the proof-of-concept calculation. This work serves
as a concrete demonstration of how quantum computers in the intermediate term
might be used to accelerate classical LQFT calculations."

reached a precision where the electromagnetic (e.m.) correction can no longer

validate, as it leads to ultraviolet (UV) divergences and to sizeable infrared
(IR) effects associated with the massless photon. While we precisely determine
the UV divergence using the operator-product expansion, we propose to introduce
a separation scale $\Lambda\sim400\;$MeV into the internal photon propagator,
whereby the calculation splits into a short-distance part, regulated in the UV
by the lattice and in the IR by the scale $\Lambda$, and a UV-finite
long-distance part to be treated with coordinate-space methods, thereby
avoiding power-law finite-size effects altogether. In order to predict the
long-distance part, we express the UV-regulated e.m. correction to the HVP via
the forward hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering amplitude and relate the
latter via a dispersive sum rule to $\gamma^*\gamma^*$ fusion cross-sections.
Having tested the relation by reproducing the two-loop QED vacuum polarization
(VP) from the tree-level $\gamma^*\gamma^*\to e^+e^-$ cross-section, we predict
the expected lattice-QCD integrand resulting from the
$\gamma^*\gamma^*\to\pi^0$ process."

understand confinement to deconfinement transitions at finite temperatures,
which is typically due to the spontaneous breakdown (at large temperatures) of
the centre symmetry associated with the gauge group. Close to the transition,
the relevant degrees of freedom (Polyakov loop) transform under these centre
symmetries, and the effective theory only depends on the Polyakov loop and its
fluctuations. As shown first by Svetitsky and Yaffe, and subsequently verified
numerically, for the $U(1)$ LGT in $(2+1)$-d the transition is in the 2-d XY
universality class, while for the $Z_2$ LGT, it is in the 2-d Ising
universality class. We extend this classic scenario by adding higher charged
matter fields, and show that the notion of universality is generalized such
that the critical exponents $\gamma, \nu$ can change continuously as a coupling
is varied, while their ratio is fixed to the 2-d Ising value. While such weak
universality is well-known for spin models, we demonstrate this for LGTs for
the first time. Using an efficient cluster algorithm, we show that the finite
temperature phase transition of the $U(1)$ quantum link LGT in the spin

inclusive semi-leptonic decays of charmed mesons. In view of the long-standing
tension in the determination of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{ub}|$ and
$|V_{cb}|$ from exclusive and inclusive processes, recently, the use of lattice
QCD has been extended towards the description of inclusive decays. Since the
determination of hadronic input parameters from QCD based methods require
independent tests, we focus on the charm sector, since it not only offers
experimental data, but also well determined CKM parameters. We carry out a
pilot lattice simulation for the $D_s \rightarrow X_s \ell\nu$ and explore the
improvement of existing techniques. Our simulation employs M\""obius domain-wall
charm and strange quarks whose masses are tuned to be approximately physical
and we cover the whole kinematical region. We report on our progress in
analyzing different sources of systematic effects, such as the extrapolation of
the kernel function chosen for the Chebsyhev approximation as well as the
influence on the analysis in the region close to the kinematical limit."
