Kellner')],"We consider certain generalized binomial sums $\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell)$ and
discuss the non-integrality of their values for integral parameters $n,r \geq
1$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}$ in several cases using $p$-adic methods. In
particular, we show some properties of the denominator of
$\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell)$. Viewed as polynomials, the sequence
$(\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(x))_{n \geq 0}$ forms an Appell sequence. The special
case $\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(2)$ reduces to the sum \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \frac{r}{r+k}, \] which has received some
attention in recent times from several authors regarding the conjectured
non-integrality of its values. Only specific cases have been proved yet. The
generalized results imply, among other things, for even $|\ell| \geq 2$ that
$\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell) \notin \mathbb{Z}$ when $\binom{r+n}{r}$ is even,
e.g., $r$ and $n$ are odd. Although there exist exceptions where
$\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell) \in \mathbb{Z}$, ""almost all"" values of
$\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell)$ for $n,r \geq 1$ are non-integral for any fixed
$|\ell| \geq 2$. Subsequently, we also derive explicit inequalities between the
parameters for which $\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell) \notin \mathbb{Z}$. Especially,
this is shown for certain small values of $\ell$ for $r \geq n$ and $n > r \geq
\frac{1}{5} n$. As a supplement, we finally discuss exceptional cases where
$\mathcal{S}_{(r,n)}(\ell) \in \mathbb{Z}$."

non-trivial algebraic/analytic structure on the set of Riemann zeros. The
duality between primes and Riemann zeta function zeros suggests some new goals
and aspects to be studied: {\em adelic duality} and the {\em POSet of prime
numbers}.
  The article presents computational evidence of the structure of the imaginary
parts $t$ of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\rho=1/2+it$,
called in this article the {\em Riemann Spectrum}, using the study of their
distribution.
  The novelty represents in considering the associated characters $p^{it}$,
towards an algebraic point of view, than rather in the sense of Analytic Number
Theory. This structure is tentatively interpreted in terms of adelic
characters, and the duality of the rationals.
  Second, the POSet structure of prime numbers studied, is tentatively mirrored
via duality in the Riemann spectrum. A direct study of the convergence of their
Fourier series, along Pratt trees, is proposed.

distributions, in terms of Hecke idelic characters, local zeta integrals

the Bergman kernel of the space. We prove the conjectured lower bound for all
such $n,g,S$ and prove the upper bound in the $k$ aspect when $n=1$, $g \ge 1$.
  When $n=1$ and $g=1$, we make a more refined study of the sizes of the
index-(old and) new spaces, the latter via the Waldspurger's formula. Towards
this and with independent interest, we prove a power saving asymptotic formula
for the averages of the twisted central $L$-values $L(1/2, f \otimes \chi_D)$

\to \infty$ and $D$ being (explicitly) polynomially bounded by $k,p$. Here
$\chi_D$ is a real quadratic Dirichlet character.
  We also prove that the size of the space of Saito-Kurokawa lifts (of even
weight $k$) is $k^{5/2}$ by three different methods (with or without the use of
central $L$-values), and show that the size of their pullbacks to the
diagonally embedded $\mathbb H \times \mathbb H$ is $k^2$.

Miller'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prakod Ngamlamai'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew Phang')]","Given a group $G$, we say that a set $A \subseteq G$ has more sums than
differences (MSTD) if $|A+A| > |A-A|$, has more differences than sums (MDTS) if
$|A+A| < |A-A|$, or is sum-difference balanced if $|A+A| = |A-A|$. A problem of
recent interest has been to understand the frequencies of these type of
subsets.
  The seventh author and Vissuet studied the problem for arbitrary finite
groups $G$ and proved that almost all subsets $A\subseteq G$ are sum-difference
balanced as $|G|\to\infty$. For the dihedral group $D_{2n}$, they conjectured
that of the remaining sets, most are MSTD, i.e., there are more MSTD sets than
MDTS sets. Some progress on this conjecture was made by Haviland et al. in
2020, when they introduced the idea of partitioning the subsets by size: if,
for each $m$, there are more MSTD subsets of $D_{2n}$ of size $m$ than MDTS
subsets of size $m$, then the conjecture follows.
  We extend the conjecture to generalized dihedral groups
$D=\mathbb{Z}_2\ltimes G$, where $G$ is an abelian group of size $n$ and the
nonidentity element of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts by inversion. We make further
progress on the conjecture by considering subsets with a fixed number of
rotations and reflections. By bounding the expected number of overlapping sums,
we show that the collection $\mathcal S_{D,m}$ of subsets of the generalized
dihedral group $D$ of size $m$ has more MSTD sets than MDTS sets when $6\le
m\le c_j\sqrt{n}$ for $c_j=1.3229/\sqrt{111+5j}$, where $j$ is the number of
elements in $G$ with order at most $2$. We also analyze the expectation for
$|A+A|$ and $|A-A|$ for $A\subseteq D_{2n}$, proving an explicit formula for
$|A-A|$ when $n$ is prime."

to bound the probability of vanishing to order at least $r$ at the central
point for families of cuspidal newforms of prime level $N \to \infty$, split by
sign. There are three methods to improve bounds on the order of vanishing:
optimizing the test functions, increasing the support, and increasing the
$n$-level density studied. Previous work determined the optimal test functions
for the $1$ and $2$-level densities in certain support ranges, leading to
marginal improvements in bounds and making it not a productive avenue for
further research. Similarly the support has been increased as far as possible,
and further progress is shown to be related to delicate and difficult
conjectures in number theory. Thus we concentrate on the third method, and
study the higher centered moments (which are similar to the $n$-level densities
but combinatorially easier). We find the level at each rank for which the
bounds on the order of vanishing is the best, thus producing world-record
bounds on the order of vanishing to rank at least $r$ for every $r > 2$ (for
example, our bounds for vanishing to order at least 5 or at least 6 are less
than half the previous bounds, a significant improvement). Additionally, we
explicitly calculate the optimal test function for the $1$-level density from
previous work and compare it to the naive test functions for higher levels. In
doing so, we find that the optimal test function for certain levels are not the
optimal for other levels, and some test functions may outperform others for
some levels but not in others. Finally, we explicitly calculate the integrals
needed to determine the bounds, doing so by transforming an $n$-dimensional
integral to a $1$-dimensional integral and greatly reducing the computation
cost in the process."

related to real numbers in the unit interval. Here we consider the iterated
dynamics of a graph operator $\cal R$ over the set of Haros graphs. This
operator was previously defined in the realm of graph-theoretical
characterisation of low-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and has a
renormalization group (RG) structure. We find that the dynamics of $\cal R$
over Haros graphs is complex and includes unstable periodic orbits or arbitrary
period and non-mixing aperiodic orbits, overall portraiting a chaotic RG flow.
We identify a single RG stable fixed point whose basin of attraction is the set
of rational numbers, associate periodic RG orbits with (pure) quadratic
irrationals and aperiodic RG orbits with (non-mixing) families of non-quadratic
algebraic irrationals and trascendental numbers. Finally, we show that the
entropy gradients inside periodic RG orbits are constant. We discuss the
possible physical interpretation of such chaotic RG flow and speculate on the
entropy-constant periodic orbits as a possible confirmation of a (quantum
field-theoretic) $c$-theorem applied inside the invariant set of a RG flow."

probability theory and have been studied extensively from these points of view.
However, very little is known about their irreducibility and Galois properties.
Just like many classical families of orthogonal polynomials (e.g. the Legendre
and Laguerre), the Krawtchouck polynomials can be viewed as special cases of
Jacobi polynomials. In this paper we determine the Newton Polygons of certain
Krawtchouck polynomials and show that they are very similar to those of the
Legendre polynomials (and exhibit new cases of irreducibility). However, we
also show that their Galois groups are significantly more complicated to study,
due to the nature of their coefficients, versus those of other classical
