line. Chern made a conjecture in 1977 that an affine maximal graph of a smooth,
locally uniformly convex function on two-dimensional Euclidean space $\R^2$
must be a paraboloid. In 2000, Trudinger and Wang completed the proof of this
conjecture in affine geometry. (Caution: in these literatures, the term ""affine
geometry"" refers to ""equi-affine geometry"".) A natural problem arises: Whether
the hyperbola is the fully affine maximal curve in $\R^2$? In this paper, by
utilizing the evolution equations for curves, we obtain the second variational
formula for fully affine extremal curves in $\R^2$, and show the fully affine
maximal curves in $\R^2$ are much more abundant and include the explicit curves
$y=x^\alpha ~\left(\alpha\;\text{is a constant

time, we generalize the fundamental theory of curves in higher dimensions,
equipped with $\text{GA}(n)=\text{GL}(n)\ltimes\R^n$. Moreover, in fully affine
plane geometry, an isoperimetric inequality is investigated, and a complete
classification of the solitons for fully affine heat flow is provided. We also
study the local existence, uniqueness, and long-term behavior of this fully
affine heat flow. A closed embedded curve will converge to an ellipse when
evolving according to the fully affine heat flow is proved."

characters on commutative Banach algebra is homeomorphic to the underlying
space. This fact is used in solving the Calder\'on problem in dimension 2 via
the boundary control (BC) method. To apply the BC method in dimension 3, the
algebra of complex holomorphic functions can be replaced by the space of
harmonic quaternion fields, but this space is no longer an algebra and is not
commutative. Nonetheless, it has been shown that a suitable notion of a
spectrum exists and in the case when the underlying space is convex, the
spectrum is homeomorphic to the ball. Our goal is to generalize this result to
more general manifolds in arbitrary dimension. To do so, we use Clifford
algebras of multivector fields and the set of functions we care about is the
space monogenic spinor fields. The spectrum consists of spinor valued
functionals that respect the module and subalgebra structure of the space of
monogenic spinor fields. We prove that for compact regions in $\mathbb{R}^n$,
the spectrum is homeomorphic to the manifold itself. Furthermore, some
essential lemmas and propositions are proven for arbitrary compact Riemannian
$n$-manifolds. Finally, we end with a Stone--Weierstrass theorem which shows
the algebra generated by the monogenic spinor fields on arbitrary compact $M$
with boundary is dense in the algebra of continuous spinor fields."

of the tangent bundle into $k>2$ subbundles, appears in theories of $k$-nets

twisted products. We study a variational problem, which can be viewed as the
geometrical part of an Einstein-Hilbert type action on an almost product
manifold $(M,{\cal D}_1,\ldots,{\cal D}_k)$, namely, we consider integrated sum
of mixed scalar curvatures of several distributions, as a functional of an
adapted pseudo-Riemannian metric (i.e., keeping the pairwise orthogonality of
the distributions) and a linear connection. We find the Euler-Lagrange
equations of this action: for adapted variations of metric (which is similar to
the Einstein equation, where the Ricci tensor is replaced by the new Ricci type
tensor) and for variations of a linear connection, in terms of contorsion
tensor. Unlike in the Einstein-Cartan theory, metrics admitting critical
contorsions are severely restricted -- to those that make all distributions
totally umbilical. We examine further these restrictions in special cases:
twisted products and 3-Sasaki manifolds with naturally defined $k=4$
distributions. On the other hand, considering variations of connection among
statistical connections allows us to obtain examples of critical pairs
metric-contorsion from critical adapted metrics of the action with zero

can be identified with sphere congruences that are entities of Moebius
geometry. Discrete Koenigs nets are defined via the existence of the so called

affine connection is a natural problem. In this context, A. V. Gavrilov
introduced the notion of framed Lie algebra, consisting of a Lie bracket (the
usual Jacobi bracket of vector fields) and a magmatic product without any
compatibility relations between them. In this work we will show that an affine
connection with curvature and torsion always gives rise to a post-Lie algebra
as well as a $D$-algebra. The notions of torsion and curvature together with
Gavrilov's special polynomials and double exponential are revisited in this
post-Lie algebraic framework. We unfold the relations between the post-Lie
Magnus expansion, the Grossman-Larson product and the $K$-map, $\alpha$-map and
$\beta$-map, three particular functions introduced by Gavrilov with the aim of
understanding the geometric and algebraic properties of the double-exponential,
which can be understood as a geometric variant of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff
formula. We propose a partial answer to a conjecture by Gavrilov, by showing
that a particular class of geometrically special polynomials is generated by
torsion and curvature. This approach unlocks many possibilities for further
research such as numerical integrators and rough paths on Riemannian manifolds."

formulas generalize some results for foliated Riemannian manifolds and involve
the shape operators of ${\mathcal F}$ with respect to normals in ${\mathcal D}$

1 Introduction

   Since the discovery of Quaternions by Olinde Rodrigues[2] and Sir William
Hamilton[3] independently in 1840 and 1843, the anti-commutative Division
Algebras of H and subsequently O have been the de facto generalization of the
Complex Numbers in mathematical research.",2022-12-05 05:01:28+00:00,The LG Fibration,math.DG,"['math.DG', 'cs.AI']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Daniel Livschitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weiqing Gu')]","Deep Learning has significantly impacted the application of data-to-decision
throughout research and industry, however, they lack a rigorous mathematical
foundation, which creates situations where algorithmic results fail to be
practically invertible. In this paper we present a nearly invertible mapping
between $\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ via a topological connection
between $S^{2^n-1}$ and $S^n$. Throughout the paper we utilize the algebra of
Multicomplex rotation groups and polyspherical coordinates to define two maps:
the first is a contraction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $\displaystyle \otimes^n_{k=1}
SO(2)$, and the second is a projection from $\displaystyle \otimes^n_{k=1}
SO(2)$ to $S^{n}$. Together these form a composite map that we call the LG
Fibration. In analogy to the generation of Hopf Fibration using Hypercomplex
geometry from $S^{(2n-1)} \mapsto CP^n$, our fibration uses Multicomplex
geometry to project $S^{2^n-1}$ onto $S^n$. We also investigate the algebraic
properties of the LG Fibration, ultimately deriving a distance difference
function to determine which pairs of vectors have an invariant inner product
under the transformation. The LG Fibration has applications to Machine Learning
and AI, in analogy to the current applications of Hopf Fibrations in adaptive
UAV control. Furthermore, the ability to invert the LG Fibration for nearly all
elements allows for the development of Machine Learning algorithms that may
avoid the issues of uncertainty and reproducibility that currently plague
contemporary methods. The primary result of this paper is a novel method of
nearly invertible geometric dimensional reduction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $S^n$,

Discovering the LG Fibration was made possible because of the clear
connection between geometry and algebra in the Multicomplex numbers, and
our hope through this paper is to inspire further research into the applications
of geometric groups embedded in high dimensional spaces.","Future publications should
aim to utilize the abelian rotation and hyperbolic groups in Cn for
mathematical physics, such as generalizing how the split complex numbers
may be used to perform a Lorentz boost in 1+1 Minkowski space.","References

through Theorem B and Theorem C, which explicitly classify all left invariant conic Landsberg

   Theorem D is a little surprising, because all known results in literature can only prove
the Landsberg Conjecture or its analog from the positive side, when the metric is globally
deﬁned, or provide counter examples from the negative side, when the metric is conic or permits
singularities.",Problem E Look for homogeneous conic Landsberg metrics and explore if they are Berwald.,2022-12-13 13:05:06+00:00,Special left invariant conic Finsler metrics and homogeneous conic Landsberg Problem in two dimension,math.DG,['math.DG'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Ming Xu')],"In this paper, we study left invariant conic Finsler metrics on the
