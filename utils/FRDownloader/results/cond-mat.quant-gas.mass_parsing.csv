Christodoulou et al. Nature 594, 191 (2021). Based on the dynamic structure
factor, we identify the two sound modes as the Bogoliubov (B) and the
non-Bogoliubov (NB) sound mode below the transition, and as the diffusive and
the normal sound mode above the transition. The NB sound mode velocity is
higher than the B sound mode velocity, which we refer to as the weak-coupling
regime of the sound modes. We excite the sound modes by driving the system as
in the experiment and by perturbing the density with a step-pulse perturbation,
as a secondary comparison. The driven response depends on the driving strength
and results in higher velocities for the B sound mode at high temperatures near
the transition, compared to the sound results of the dynamic structure factor

temperature dependence across the transition, which is consistent with the
experimental observation."

dimensionality is modified by varying the frequency of the harmonic trap from

Furthermore, we consider extensions to a spinful Rice-Mele model, namely a
staggered magnetic field or an Ising-type spin coupling, further reducing the
spin symmetry. The resulting models additionally allow for the transport of a
single charge in a two-component system of spinful fermions, whereas in the
absence of interactions, zero or two charges are pumped. In the SU(2)-symmetric

single singularity. Adding a staggered magnetic field additionally transports
an integer amount of spin while the Ising term realizes a pure charge pump. We

the many-body polarization to confirm the adiabatic nature of the pump. The

when two fermions get as close as the interaction range, and consider
perturbatively the correction of the spin-orbit coupling up to the second
order, in which new scattering parameters are introduced. Then for elastic
collisions, the scattering phase shifts are defined according to the unitary
scattering $S$ matrix. We show how the low-energy behavior of the scattering
phase shifts is modified by these new scattering parameters introduced by
spin-orbit coupling. The universality of the scattering phase shifts is
manifested as the independence of the specific form of the interatomic
potential. The explicit forms of the new scattering parameters are analytically
derived within a model of the spherical-square-well potential. Our method
provides a unified description of the low-energy properties of scattering phase

molecular state and molecule-hole continuum in the former case by means of
analytically research. The spectrum functions of molecular and polaron states

spectral signals of molecular and polaron states will both diffuse firstly and
then revives as the dissipation is on the raise. Moreover, it is shown that the
attractive and repulsive polarons show different response to the increasing

harmonically trapped one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas in the quasicondensate
regime using a finite-temperature classical field approach. By characterising
the oscillations via the dynamics of the density profile's rms width over long
time, we find that the rms width displays beating of two distinct frequencies.
This means that 1D Bose gas oscillates not at a single breathing mode
frequency, as found in previous studies, but as a superposition of two distinct
breathing modes, one oscillating at frequency close to $\simeq\!\sqrt{3}\omega$
and the other at $\simeq\!2\omega$, where $\omega$ is the trap frequency. The
breathing mode at $\sim\!\sqrt{3}\omega$ dominates the beating at lower

oscillations of the bulk of the density distribution comprised of particles

unitarity (where $a$ diverges). The absolute positions of the observed Efimov

Lyapunov exponents in analytic form are obtained to characterize the transition
points. Under the open boundary condition, two delocalization transitions are
found due to the competition between the boundary localization and the Anderson
localization. Although the second transition can be characterized by the
winding numbers, all the two delocalization transitions don't accompany the
topological transition. The second delocalization transition is dominated by
the quasiperiodic hopping due to the lack of boundary locations which is
similar to the periodic boundary case. Furthermore, the on-site non-Hermiticity
