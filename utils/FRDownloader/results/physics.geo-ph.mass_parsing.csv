temporary seismic stations were installed in remote sites that enabled studying
the stationarity of their characteristic microtremor HVSR (MHVSR) shapes. All
stations began to operate in mid-2016 and recorded at least one year of
continuous seismic ambient noise data, having up to two years in some. Each
seismic station counted with a monitored borehole in their vicinity,
registering the groundwater level every 30 minutes. The MHVSR curves were
calculated for time windows of 150 s and averaged hourly. Four parameters have
been defined to characterize the shape of the MHVSR around the main peak and to
compare them with several environmental variables. Correlations between MHVSR
characteristics and the groundwater level showed to be the most persistent. The
robustness of MHVSR method for applications to seismic engineering was not
found to be compromised since the observed variations were within the margins
of acceptable deviations. Our results widen the possibilities of the MHVSR
method from being a reliable predictor for seismic resonance to also being an
autonomous monitoring tool, especially sensitive to the S-wave modifications."

E\""otv\""os' famous high-precision verification of the equivalence of

general relativity. A new chapter of these measurements began in 1985, when
Fischbach and his colleagues discovered regularities in the small deviations
detected by E\""otv\""os, which had previously been considered random. This led
to the short-range 5th force hypothesis, whose existence and the source still

modernization of the E\""otv\""os torsion-balance, the repetition of the EPF
equivalence principle measurement and the investigation of the source of the
5th force in connection with the E\""otv\""os Year 2019. During the experiment,
particular emphasis was put on the analysis of environmental (e.g.
microseismic) disturbances and the detection and filtering of the resulting,
sometimes systematic, errors. These perturbations included earthquakes, which
have been detected by the modernized E\""otv\""os balance since the beginning of
the experiment.
  Another application of the torsion balance was discovered by Russian
researchers around 1990-1992, who noticed that in some cases the equilibrium
position of the balance shifts noticeably up to 2 days before earthquakes. On
this basis, the researchers proposed the possibility of using torsion balances
to predict earthquakes.
  The earthquake in Greece on 9 January 2022 was recorded by both a G\""uralp 3T
broadband seismometer and an E\""otv\""os torsion balance, which were placed side
by side in our laboratory. However, more than 30 minutes before the eruption

not visible on the seismogram taken by the G\""uralp 3T seismometer. In this

${km}^2$ Aleppo pine forest growing at the semi-arid timberline (with no
irrigation or fertilization). The organic carbon sequestration rate (above and
below ground) was measured as 550 gram $CO_2 {m}^{-2} {yr}^{-1}$, by Eddy
Covariance flux and Carbon Stock counting methods. Assuming that the soil
composition at Yatir is representative, we estimate a global organic
sequestration rate of roughly 3.0 billion tons $CO_2$ per year, after future
global forestation, by extrapolating to 20% of the global semi-arid area.
Consider now the inorganic carbon sequestration rate. $CO_2$ exhaled into the
soil by tree roots is hydrated by soil water to produce mainly bicarbonate
${{HCO}_3}^-$, which combines with soil ${Ca}^{2+}$ to precipitate calcite
${CaCO}_3$. We quantify the annual sequestration rate in Yatir soil cores by
measuring the decreased density versus depth, of bicarbonates in the liquid
phase of the soil unsaturated zone (USZ). We found that the bicarbonate
concentration decreases with depth, as the calcite precipitates and is
incorporated within the USZ. The depth profiles were converted to time
profiles, taking into account the $\approx 11 cm/yr$ annual rate of downward
water percolation at Yatir. In 1 Liter of sediment, using data from a core
depth of 2.2 meters, the calcite precipitation rate was measured as 22 mg $CO_2

respiration, extrapolating as above, roughly 0.8 billion tons of $CO_2$ could
potentially be sequestered globally each year. The total organic plus inorganic
sequestration rate is then $\approx 4$ billion tons $CO_2$ per year. This
demonstrates the global potential, the need for further measurements, and the

acquisition of seismic data, in recent decades considerable effort has been put
into so-called simultaneous shooting acquisitions, where seismic sources are
fired at short time intervals between each other. As a consequence, waves
originating from consecutive shots are entangled within the seismic recordings,
yielding so-called blended data. For processing and imaging purposes, the data
generated by each individual shot must be retrieved. This process, called
deblending, is achieved by solving an inverse problem which is heavily
underdetermined. Conventional approaches rely on transformations that render
the blending noise into burst-like noise, whilst preserving the signal of
interest. Compressed sensing type regularization is then applied, where
sparsity in some domain is assumed for the signal of interest. The domain of
choice depends on the geometry of the acquisition and the properties of seismic
data within the chosen domain. In this work, we introduce a new concept that
consists of embedding a self-supervised denoising network into the
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework. A novel network is introduced whose design
extends the blind-spot network architecture of [28 ] for partially coherent
noise (i.e., correlated in time). The network is then trained directly on the
noisy input data at each step of the PnP algorithm. By leveraging both the
underlying physics of the problem and the great denoising capabilities of our
blind-spot network, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform an
industry-standard method whilst being comparable in terms of computational
cost. Moreover, being independent on the acquisition geometry, our method can
be easily applied to both marine and land data without any significant

that electrostatic-driven transport requires that charge be present on

approximately 1 week. In moist, humid environments, this timescale decreased to
days. These results were independent of particle material and charge polarity.
However, exposure to UV radiation could both increase or decrease the decay
time depending on polarity. These results suggest that the rate of charge decay

focused on elucidating the charging processes, comparatively little effort has
been expended understanding the stability of charge on particles once
electrified. Overall, electrostatic-driven transport requires that charge
remain present on particles for days to weeks. Here, we present a set of
experiments designed to explore the longevity of electrostatic charge on
levitated airborne particles after a single charging event. Using an acoustic
levitator, we measured the charge on particles of different material
compositions suspended in atmospheric conditions for long periods of time. In
dry environments, the total charge on particles decayed in over 1 week. The
decay timescale decreased to days in humid environments. These results were
independent of particle material and charge polarity. However, exposure to UV
radiation could both increase or decrease the decay time depending on polarity.
Our work suggests that the rate of charge decay on airborne particles is solely
determined by ion capture from the air. Furthermore, using a one-dimensional
sedimentation model, we predict that atmospheric dust of order 10 $\mu$m will
experience the largest change in residence time due to electrostatic forces."

information necessary to understand the effect of trees on urban environments.
In this study, we demonstrate a method for estimating the leaf area density
(LAD) distribution of individual trees using high-resolution airborne LiDAR.
This method improves upon the previously proposed method, which calculates LAD
based on the contact frequency between the laser beams and leaves by tracing
the paths of the laser beams. The proposed method in this study exploits the
last and intermediate pulses in addition to the first and single pulses to
capture the foliage distribution in the inner part of the crown. Each laser
beam is traced from a point derived by the last pulse to the point derived by
the first or intermediate pulse that is recorded immediately before the last
pulse. The laser beam interceptions and intersections can thus be accurately
reproduced while considering the last and intermediate pulses. We verify the
estimation accuracy of the three-dimensional LAD distribution using terrestrial
LiDAR data from a single tree (Z. serrata). The appropriate voxel size for
representing the LAD distribution from the airborne LiDAR is first determined
by comparing the distribution of voxels containing one or more airborne LiDAR
points with that containing one or more terrestrial LiDAR points. The estimated
LAD distribution with a voxel size of 1 m by 1 m by 0.5 m is subsequently
compared to the terrestrial LiDAR-derived LAD distribution. When only the first
and single pulses are used, the LAD is overestimated and underestimated in the
upper and lower part of the crown, respectively. We confirmed that using the
last and intermediate pulses improves the estimation accuracy of the entire
crown area."

the cross-correlation imaging condition has potential for earthquake location
with high accuracy and high resolution, but carries a large computational cost.
Here we present an alternative deep-learning approach for earthquake location
by combining the benefits of neural operators for wave propagation and time
reversal imaging with multi-station waveform recordings. A U-shaped neural
operator is trained to propagate seismic waves with various source time
functions and thus can predict a backpropagated wavefield for each station in
negligible time. These wavefields can either be stacked or correlated to locate
earthquakes from the resulting source images. Compared with other
waveform-based deep-learning location methods, time reversal imaging accounts
for physical laws of wave propagation and is expected to achieve accurate
earthquake location. We demonstrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave
equation on both synthetic and field data. The results show that our method can
efficiently obtain high resolution and high accuracy correlation-based time
reversal imaging of earthquake sources. Moreover, our approach is adaptable to
the number and geometry of seismic stations, which opens new strategies for
real-time earthquake location and monitoring with dense seismic networks."
