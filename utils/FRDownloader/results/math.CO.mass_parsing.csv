'generic' lower bound to obtain an exponential lower bound for a 'concrete'

Consequently, we can write down the Ehrhart polynomial of $P_M$, starting with
Katzman's formula for the Ehrhart polynomial of a hypersimplex. The method
builds on and generalizes Ferroni's work on sparse paving matroids.
Combinatorially, our construction corresponds to constructing a uniform matroid
from a paving matroid by iterating the operation of stressed-hyperplane
relaxation introduced by Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi, which generalizes the
standard matroid-theoretic notion of circuit-hyperplane relaxation. We present
evidence that panhandle matroids are Ehrhart positive and describe a
conjectured combinatorial formula involving chain gangs and Eulerian numbers
from which Ehrhart positivity of panhandle matroids will follow. As an
application of the main result, we calculate the Ehrhart polynomials of
matroids associated with Steiner systems and finite projective planes, and show
that they depend only on their design-theoretic parameters: for example, while

obtained from a hypersimplex by slicing off subpolytopes. The pieces removed
are base polytopes of lattice path matroids corresponding to panhandle-shaped
Ferrers diagrams, whose Ehrhart polynomials we can calculate explicitly.
Consequently, we can write down the Ehrhart polynomial of $P_M$, starting with
Katzman's formula for the Ehrhart polynomial of a hypersimplex. The method
builds on and generalizes Ferroni's work on sparse paving matroids.
Combinatorially, our construction corresponds to constructing a uniform matroid
from a paving matroid by iterating the operation of stressed-hyperplane
relaxation introduced by Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi, which generalizes the
standard matroid-theoretic notion of circuit-hyperplane relaxation. We present
evidence that panhandle matroids are Ehrhart positive and describe a
conjectured combinatorial formula involving chain gangs and Eulerian numbers
from which Ehrhart positivity of panhandle matroids will follow. As an
application of the main result, we calculate the Ehrhart polynomials of
matroids associated with Steiner systems and finite projective planes, and show
that they depend only on their design-theoretic parameters: for example, while
projective planes of the same order need not have isomorphic matroids, their
base polytopes must be Ehrhart equivalent."

The proof of Theorem 1 presents an upper bound for the number of graphs with
distance rank equals k in terms of the Ramsey number R(k).","In the proof of Theorem 5, we assign values to (|Wi|, |Wi,1|, |Wi,2|) so that Ai
has nullity 1, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. We can see that the matrix Ai has nullity 1 if
and only if (|Wi|, |Wi,1|, |Wi,2|) is one of (2, 3, 3), (2, 2, 5), (2, 5, 2), (3, 2, 2), (3, 1, 5),
(3, 5, 1), (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 1), (6, 1, 2), and (6, 2, 1), for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. In particular we use
(3, 2, 2) because with this choice we obtain the minimum lower bound for the number
of vertices.","Nevertheless, this upper
bound seems to be far from being tight.",2022-03-04 17:33:37+00:00,On the rank of the distance matrix of graphs,math.CO,['math.CO'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Ezequiel Dratman'), arxiv.Result.Author('Luciano N.

$(i,j)$-entry of the distance matrix $D(G)$ of $G$ is the distance between

prove that for each integer $k\ge 2$, there is a finite amount of graphs whose
distance matrices have rank $k$. We exhibit the list of graphs with distance
matrices of rank $2$ and $3$. Besides, we study the rank of the distance
matrices of graphs belonging to a family of graphs with their diameters at most
two, the trivially perfect graphs. We show that for each $\eta\ge 1$ there
exists a trivially perfect graph with nullity $\eta$. We also show that for

cluster-permutohedron, a certain poset defined for a simple graph $\Gamma$.
This poset is very similar to the graphicahedron of $\Gamma$, in particular,
1-skeleta of both posets are isomorphic to Cayley graphs of the symmetric
group. In general, two posets are related via Galois connection, and
cluster-permutohedron is the core of a graphicahedron. We prove that the face
poset of the natural torus action on the manifold of isospectral
$\Gamma$-shaped Hermitian matrices is isomorphic to the cluster-permutohedron.
Using recent results in toric topology, we show that certain homotopy
properties of graphicahedra may be an obstruction to equivariant formality of
isospectral matrix manifolds. We also introduce a generalization of

this article, we define a generalization of the Tutte polynomial to oriented
graphs and regular oriented matroids. To any regular oriented matroid $N$, we
associate a polynomial invariant $A_N(q,y,z)$, which we call the A-polynomial.
The A-polynomial has the following interesting properties among many others:
  1. a specialization of $A_N$ gives the Tutte polynomial of the unoriented
matroid underlying $N$,
  2. when the oriented matroid $N$ corresponds to an unoriented matroid (that
is, when the elements of the ground set come in pairs with opposite
orientations), the $A$-polynomial is equivalent to the Tutte polynomial of this
unoriented matroid (up to a change of variables),
  3. the A-polynomial $A_N$ detects, among other things, whether $N$ is acyclic
and whether $N$ is totally cyclic.
  We explore various properties and specializations of the A-polynomial. We
show that some of the known properties or the Tutte polynomial of matroids can
be extended to the A-polynomial of regular oriented matroids. For instance, we
show that a specialization of $A_N$ counts all the acyclic orientations
obtained by reorienting some elements of $N$, according to the number of
reoriented elements."

unexplored. In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of mixed
lattices and their relationships, and establish the equivalence of the
one-sided associative, distributive and modular laws in mixed lattices. We also
give an alternative definition of mixed lattices and mixed lattice groups as
non-commutative and non-associative algebras satisfying a certain set of

be equivalent."

7 Concluding remarks

Our methods for bounding product-free subsets of the alternating group have justiﬁed the intuitive idea that globalness
can be regarded as a pseudorandomness notion, by showing estimates on the eigenvalues of Cayley operators for global
sets that correspond to the intuition for random sets.","We also propose the study of extremal problems for word maps in general groups (see the survey of Shalev [12]
for background).",2022-05-30 15:45:34+00:00,On the Largest Product-free Subsets of the Alternating Groups,math.CO,['math.CO'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Peter Keevash'), arxiv.Result.Author('Noam Lifshitz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Dor Minzer')]","A subset $A$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if there is no solution to
$a=bc$ with $a,b,c$ all in $A$. It is easy to see that the largest product-free
subset of the symmetric group $S_n$ is obtained by taking the set of all odd
permutations, i.e. $S_n \setminus A_n$, where $A_n$ is the alternating group.
By contrast, it is a long-standing open problem to find the largest
product-free subset of $A_n$. We solve this problem for large $n$, showing that
the maximum size is achieved by the previously conjectured extremal examples,
namely families of the form $\{\pi~|~\pi(x)\in I, \pi(I)\cap I=\emptyset\}$ and
their inverses. Moreover, we show that the maximum size is only achieved by
these extremal examples, and we have stability: any product-free subset of
$A_n$ of nearly maximum size is structurally close to an extremal example. Our
proof uses a combination of tools from Combinatorics and Non-abelian Fourier
Analysis, including a crucial new ingredient exploiting some recent theory
developed by Filmus, Kindler, Liftshitz and Minzer for global
hypercontractivity on the symmetric group."

stories with an underlying theme of combinatorics emerging from scattering
amplitudes in quantum field theories.
  The first part tells the tale of the $c_2$-invariant, an arithmetic invariant
related to the Feynman integral in $\phi^4$-theory, which studies the zeros of
the Kirchoff polynomial and related graph polynomials. Through reformulating
the $c_2$-invariant as a purely combinatorial problem, we show how enumerating
certain edge bipartitions through fixed-point free involutions can complete a
special case of the long sought after $c_2$ completion conjecture.
  The second part tells the tale of the positive Grassmannian and a
combinatorial T-duality map on its cells, as related to scattering amplitudes
in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM theory. In particular, T-duality is a bridge
between triangulations of the hypersimplex and triangulations of the
amplituhedron, two objects that appear as images of the positive Grassmannian.
We give an algorithm for viewing T-duality as a map on Le diagrams and
characterize a nice structure to the Le diagrams (which can then be used in
lieu of the algorithm). Through this Le diagram perspective on T-duality, we
show how the dimensional relationship between the positroid cells on either

expansion in the basis $\{ \chi^{\lambda} \}$ of irreducible
$\mathfrak{S}_n$-characters. To do so, we introduce a new {\em path power sum
basis} $\{ \vec{p}_{\mu} \}$ of the ring of symmetric functions and prove a
Path Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule for the Schur expansion of $\vec{p}_{\mu}$. This
rule involves novel ribbon tableau combinatorics distinct from the classical
Murnaghan-Nakayama Rule and gives a formula for the character sums $\sum_w
\chi^{\lambda}(w)$ over permutations $w \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ with fixed values
in certain positions.
  We also introduce a family of local functions we call {\em regular} that
count weighted occurrences of patterns. Using the theory of character
polynomials for the symmetric group, we show regular class functions can be
interpreted as multivariate rational functions. This allows us to generalize
results of Dimitrov-Khare, Gaetz-Pierson, Gaetz-Ryba on moments for permutation
pattern counting statistics and recover a result of Khare-Lorentz-Yan on
pattern counting in perfect matchings. We compute conditional expectations for
regular statistics applied to uniformly random permutations with a fixed cycle

A graph $G$ is said to be
$\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any element of $\mathcal{F}$ as a
subgraph. The Tur\'an number is the maximum possible number of edges in an
$\mathcal{F}$-free graph with $n$ vertices. It is well known that classical
Tur\'an type extremal problem aims to study the Tur\'an number of fixed graphs.
In 2010, Nikiforov \cite{Nik2} proposed analogously a spectral Tur\'an type
problem which asks to determine the maximum spectral radius of an
$\mathcal{F}$-free graph with $n$ vertices. It attracts much attention and many
such problems remained elusive open even after serious attempts, and so they
are considered as one of the most intriguing problems in spectral extremal
graph theory. It is interesting to consider another spectral Tur\'an type
problem which asks to determine the maximum spectral radius of an
$\mathcal{F}$-free graph with $m$ edges. Denote by $\mathcal{G}(m,\mathcal{F})$
the set of $\mathcal{F}$-free graphs with $m$ edges having no isolated
vertices. Each of the graphs among $\mathcal{G}(m,\mathcal{F})$ having the
largest spectral radius is called the maximal graph. Let $\theta_{p,q,r}$ be a
theta graph formed by connecting two distinct vertices with three independent
paths of length $p,q$ and $r,$ respectively (length refers to the number of
edges). In this paper, we firstly determine the unique maximal graph among
$\mathcal{G}(m,\theta_{1,2,3})$ and $\mathcal{G}(m,\theta_{1,2,4}),$
respectively. Then we identify the unique maximal graph among
$\mathcal{G}(m,\{\theta_{1,2,2},\theta_{1,2,3}\})$ excluding complete bipartite
graphs. At last, we determine all the maximal graphs among $\mathcal{G}(m,C_5)$

Benjamin and Bennett's bijection between coprime and non-coprime pairs, which
is based on the sequences of quotients visited by dilcuE's algorithm (i.e.
Euclid's algorithm ran backward). This allows us to break our analysis of the
quotients in three parts, namely the enumeration and count of: (1) sequences of
constant terms, (2) sequences of degrees, and (3) sequences of intermediate
terms. For (1), we show that the sequences of constant terms form a regular
language, and use classic results from algebraic language theory to count them.
Concerning (2), we remark that the sequences of degrees correspond to
compositions of natural numbers, which have a simple combinatorial description.
Finally, we show that for (3) the intermediate terms can be freely chosen.
Putting these three obeservations together, we devise a combinatorial algorithm
to enumerate all such coprime pairs of a given degree, and present an

with two generators $W_0$, $W_1$ and two relations called the $q$-Serre
relations. The algebra $U^+_q$ contains some elements, said to be alternating.
There are four kinds of alternating elements, denoted $\lbrace
W_{-k}\rbrace_{k\in \mathbb N}$, $\lbrace W_{k+1}\rbrace_{k\in \mathbb N}$,
$\lbrace G_{k+1}\rbrace_{k\in \mathbb N}$, $\lbrace {\tilde G}_{k+1}\rbrace_{k

tridiagonal pair is an ordered pair of diagonalizable linear maps $A, A^*$ on a
nonzero, finite-dimensional vector space $V$, that each act in a (block)
tridiagonal fashion on the eigenspaces of the other one. Let $A$, $A^*$ denote
a tridiagonal pair on $V$. Associated with this pair are six well-known direct
sum decompositions of $V$; these are the eigenspace decompositions of $A$ and
$A^*$, along with four decompositions of $V$ that are often called split.
  In our main results, we assume that $A$, $A^*$ has $q$-Serre type. Under this
assumption $A$, $A^*$ satisfy the $q$-Serre relations, and $V$ becomes an
irreducible $U^+_q$-module on which $W_0=A$ and $W_1=A^*$. We describe how the
alternating elements of $U^+_q$ act on the above six decompositions of $V$. We
show that for each decomposition, every alternating element acts in either a
(block) diagonal, (block) upper bidiagonal, (block) lower bidiagonal, or
(block) tridiagonal fashion. We investigate two special cases in detail. In the
first case the eigenspaces of $A$ and $A^*$ all have dimension one. In the
second case $A$ and $A^*$ are obtained by adjusting the adjacency matrix and a
dual adjacency matrix of a distance-regular graph that has classical parameters

Karp'), arxiv.Result.Author('Hugh Thomas')]","The q-Whittaker function associated to an integer partition is a q-analogue
of the Schur function, and is defined as the t=0 specialization of the
Macdonald polynomial. We give a new formula for the q-Whittaker function in
terms of partial flags compatible with a nilpotent endomorphism over the finite
field of size 1/q, analogous to a well-known formula for the Hall-Littlewood
functions. We show that considering pairs of partial flags and taking Jordan
forms leads to a probabilistic bijection between nonnegative-integer matrices
and pairs of semistandard tableaux of the same shape, proving the Cauchy
identity for q-Whittaker functions. We call our probabilistic bijection the
'q-Burge correspondence', and show that in the limit as q goes to 0, we recover
a description of the classical Burge correspondence (also known as column RSK)
due to Rosso (2012). A key step in the proof is the enumeration of an arbitrary
double coset of GL(n) modulo two parabolic subgroups, which we find to be of
independent interest. As an application, we use the q-Burge correspondence to
count isomorphism classes of certain modules over the preprojective algebra of
a type A quiver (i.e. a path), refined according to their socle filtrations.
This develops a connection between the combinatorics of symmetric functions and
the representation theory of preprojective algebras."

                                             Given a graph H, a graph is said to be H-free, if it does not contain a subgraph
                                         isomorphic to H. The Tura´n number of H, denoted by ex(n, H), is the maximum number
                                         of edges in an H-free graph of order n. An H-free graph on n vertices with ex(n, H)
                                         edges is called an extremal graph for H. A main purpose of studying Tura´n numbers is
                                         that they are very useful for Ramsey theory, where the original statements can be seen

numbers, denoted by ${in}(D)$ and ${hn}(D)$, respectively, in the geodetic,
${P_3}$ and ${P_3^*}$ convexities. This last one, we believe to be formally
defined and first studied in this paper, although its undirected version is
well-known in the literature. Concerning bounds, for a strongly oriented graph
$D$, we prove that ${hn_g}(D)\leq m(D)-n(D)+2$ and that there is a strongly
oriented graph such that ${hn_g}(D) = m(D)-n(D)$. We also determine exact
values for the hull numbers in these three convexities for tournaments, which
imply polynomial-time algorithms to compute them. These results allows us to
deduce polynomial-time algorithms to compute ${hn_{P_3}}(D)$ when the
underlying graph of $D$ is split or cobipartite. Moreover, we provide a
meta-theorem by proving that if deciding whether ${in_g}(D)\leq k$ or
${hn_g}(D)\leq k$ is NP-hard or W[i]-hard parameterized by $k$, for some
$i\in\mathbb{Z_+^*}$, then the same holds even if the underlying graph of $D$
is bipartite. Next, we prove that deciding whether ${hn_{P_3}}(D)\leq k$ or
${hn_{P_3^*}}(D)\leq k$ is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$, even if the
underlying graph of $D$ is bipartite; that deciding whether ${in_{P_3}}(D)\leq

cycles and the underlying graph of $D$ is a chordal bipartite graph; and that

of a largest mutual-visibility set. In this paper, the mutual-visibility number
of strong product graphs is investigated. As a tool for this, total
mutual-visibility sets are introduced. Along the way, basic properties of such
sets are presented. The (total) mutual-visibility number of strong products is
bounded from below in two ways, and determined exactly for strong grids of

bounds for their mutual-visibility number are given."

Bloom and Sagan proved that for any $k \ge 4$, the size of such $\Pi$ must be
at least $3$ unless $\Pi \subseteq \{[1, 2, \dots, k],\; [k, \dots, 1]\}$, and
asked for a general lower bound.

elements are induced connected subgraphs called tubes. Graph associahedra
generalize permutahedra, associahedra, and cyclohedra, and therefore are of
great interest to those who study Coxeter combinatorics.
  This thesis characterizes nested complexes of simplicial complexes, which we
call $\Delta$-nested complexes. From here, we can define P-nestohedra by
truncating simple polyhedra, and in more specificity define P-graph
associahedra, which are realized by repeated truncation of faces of simple
polyhedra in accordance with tubes of graphs.
  We then define hypercube-graph associahedra as a special case.
Hypercube-graph associahedra are defined by tubes and tubings on a graph with a
matching of dashed edges, with tubes and tubings avoiding those dashed edges.
These simple rules make hypercube-graph tubings a simple and intuitive
extension of classical graph tubings. We explore properties of $\Delta$-nested
complexes and P-nestohedra, and use these results to explore properties of
hypercube-graph associahedra, including their facets and faces, as well as

classical problem in geometry. Lison\v{e}k in 1997 constructed a maximum

prove that there exists no such example other than that of Lison\v{e}k. The key

the coherent configuration in Euclidean spaces and to drive diophantine
equations coming from this embedding. (ii) solve diophantine equations with
certain additional conditions of integrality of some parameters of the

$G=\square_{i=1}^tG^{(i)}$, where $\square$ denotes the Cartesian product. We
call the $G^{(i)}$ the base graphs and the product graph $G$ the host graph.
Very recently, Lichev showed that, under a mild requirement on the
isoperimetric properties of the base graphs, the component structure of the
percolated graph $G_p$ undergoes a phase transition when $p$ is around
$\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the average degree of the host graph.
  In the supercritical regime, we strengthen Lichev's result by showing that
the giant component is in fact unique, with all other components of order
$o(|G|)$, and determining the sharp asymptotic order of the giant. Furthermore,
we answer two questions posed by Lichev: firstly, we provide a construction
showing that the requirement of bounded-degree is necessary for the likely
emergence of a linear order component; secondly, we show that the isoperimetric
requirement on the base graphs can be, in fact, super-exponentially small in
the dimension. Finally, in the subcritical regime, we give an example showing
that in the case of irregular high-dimensional product graphs, there can be a
polynomially large component with high probability, very much unlike the

on. We obtain the extremal trees with the smallest and the largest spectral

the topological structure of order complexes of partially ordered sets
(posets). They also introduced the notion of recursive atom ordering, and they
proved that a finite bounded poset is CL-shellable if and only if it admits a
recursive atom ordering.
  In this paper, a generalization of the notion of recursive atom ordering is
introduced. A finite bounded poset is proven to admit such a generalized
recursive atom ordering if and only if it admits a traditional recursive atom
ordering. This is also proven equivalent to admitting a CC-shelling (a type of
shelling introduced by Kozlov) with a further property called self-consistency.
Thus, CL-shellability is proven equivalent to self-consistent CC-shellability.
As an application, the uncrossing posets, namely the face posets for stratified
spaces of planar electrical networks, are proven to be dual CL-shellable."

which $(0,1)$-matrices $A$ it is possible to change some signs such that the
permanent of $A$ equals the determinant of the resulting matrix. In 1975,
Little showed these matrices to be exactly the biadjacency matrices of
bipartite graphs excluding $K_{3,3}$ as a \{matching minor}. This was turned
into a polynomial time algorithm by McCuaig, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas in
1999. However, the relation between the exclusion of some matching minor in a
bipartite graph and the tractability of the permanent extends beyond $K_{3,3}.$
Recently it was shown that the exclusion of any planar bipartite graph as a
matching minor yields a class of bipartite graphs on which the {permanent} of
the corresponding $(0,1)$-matrices can be computed efficiently. In this paper
we unify the two results above into a single, more general result in the style
of the celebrated structure theorem for single-crossing-minor-free graphs. We
identify a class of bipartite graphs strictly generalising planar bipartite
graphs and $K_{3,3}$ which includes infinitely many non-Pfaffian graphs. The
exclusion of any member of this class as a matching minor yields a structure
that allows for the efficient evaluation of the permanent. Moreover, we show
that the evaluation of the permanent remains $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard on bipartite
graphs which exclude $K_{5,5}$ as a matching minor. This establishes a first
computational lower bound for the problem of counting perfect matchings on
matching minor closed classes."

projection of a $k$-hypersimplex, which is the convex hull of the barycenters
of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of the standard $(n-1)$-simplex. In
particular, we introduce four types of flips and prove that the level-2
hypertriangulations are connected by these flips."

without self-loops. A source in a directed graph is a vertex having at least
one ingoing arc. A quasi-kernel $Q\subseteq V(D)$ is an independent set in $D$
such that every vertex in $V(D)$ can be reached in at most two steps from a
vertex in $Q$. It is an open problem whether every source-free directed graph
has a quasi-kernel of size at most $|V(D)|/2$, a problem known as the small
quasi-kernel conjecture (SQKC). The aim of this paper is to prove the SQKC
under the assumption of a structural property of directed graphs. This relates
the SQKC to the existence of a vertex $u\in V(D)$ and a bound on the number of
new sources emerging when $u$ and its out-neighborhood are removed from $D$.
The results in this work are of technical nature and therefore additionally
verified by means of the Coq proof-assistant."

lattice $J(P)$ of order ideals of a finite poset $P$. We introduce the
rowmotion Markov chain ${\bf M}_{J(P)}$ by assigning a probability $p_x$ to
each $x\in P$ and using these probabilities to insert randomness into the
original definition of rowmotion. Barnard and Thomas--Williams extended the
definition of rowmotion from distributive lattices to semidistributive lattices
and trim lattices, respectively. Recently, the first author and Williams
further generalized rowmotion to the even broader class of semidistrim
lattices. Given a semidistrim lattice $L$, we assign a probability $p_j$ to
each join-irreducible element $j$ of $L$ and use these probabilities to
construct a rowmotion Markov chain ${\bf M}_L$. Under the assumption that each
probability $p_j$ is strictly between $0$ and $1$, we prove that ${\bf M}_{L}$
is irreducible. We bound the mixing time of ${\bf M}_{L}$ for an arbitrary
semidistrim lattice $L$, and we provide more precise bounds when $L$ is a chain
or a Boolean lattice. We compute the stationary distribution of ${\bf
M}_{J(P)}$ for an arbitrary finite poset $P$. We also compute the stationary
distribution of the rowmotion Markov chain of the lattice obtained from a
disjoint union of two chains $x_1<\cdots<x_a$ and $y_1<\cdots<y_b$ by adding a
minimal element and a maximal element."
