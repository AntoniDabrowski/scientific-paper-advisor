1\leq j\leq n$. Let $n\geq d$ and $\text{Sym}^m(\mathcal{X})$ be the Banach
space of symmetric m-tensors. If the operator $ \text{Sym}^m(\mathcal{X})\ni x

This notion is related with the notion of Lipschitz free Banach spaces. \ It is
proved that every separable metric space admits a metric $\mathcal{M}_d$-frame.
Through Lipschitz-free Banach spaces it is showed that there is a
correspondence between frames for metric spaces and frames for subsets of
Banach spaces. Several characterizations of metric frames are obtained.
Stability results are also presented. Non linear multipliers are introduced and
studied. This notion is connected with the notion of Lipschitz compact
operators. Continuity properties of multipliers are discussed.
  For a subclass of approximated Schauder frames for Banach spaces,
characterization result is derived using standard Schauder basis for standard
sequence spaces. Duals of a subclass of approximate Schauder frames are
completely described. Similarity of this class is characterized and
interpolation result is derived using orthogonality. A dilation result is
obtained. A new identity is derived for Banach spaces which admit a homogeneous
semi-inner product. Some stability results are obtained for this class.
  A generalization of operator-valued frames for Hilbert spaces are introduced
which unifies all the known generalizations of frames for Hilbert spaces. This
notion has been studied in depth by imposing factorization property of the
frame operator. Its duality, similarity and orthogonality are addressed.
Connections between this notion and unitary representations of groups and
group-like unitary systems are derived. Paley-Wiener theorem for this class are
derived."

dilation is constructed when the product $T$ is a $C._0$ contraction, that is
${T^*}^n \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. As a consequence of these
dilation theorems we obtain different functional models for $(T_1,\dots ,T_n)$

fact about our models is that the multipliers are analytic functions in one

tool in proving theorems guaranteeing metric regularity of a (set-valued)
mapping. First, we demonstrate that one should always use directly the
so-called general criterion which follows, for example, from Ekeland's
variational principle, and that there is no need to make a detour through the
slope-based consequences of this general statement. Second, we argue that when
proving perturbation stability results, in the spirit of Lyusternik-Graves
theorem, there is no need to employ the concept of a lower semi-continuous
envelope even in the case of an incomplete target space. The gist is to use the
""correct"" function to which Ekeland's variational principle is applied; namely,
the distance function to the graph of the set-valued mapping under
consideration. This approach originates in the notion of graphical regularity
introduced by L. Thibault, which is equivalent to the property of metric
regularity. Our criteria cover also both metric subregularity and metric
semiregularity, which are weaker properties obtained by fixing one of the
points in the definition of metric regularity."

the range space need not even be barrelled. Distinguishing examples are
provided that include natural constructions of range spaces connected with
applications, such as the space of distributions having their wavefront sets in

This is done at the (necessary) expense of stipulating an additional regularity
condition involving the action of the Laplacian on the functions in question
which, nonetheless, works perfectly with the Dirichlet and Neumann realizations
of the Schr\""odinger differential expression $-\Delta+V$. In turn, this
boundary trace theory serves as a platform for developing a spectral theory for
Schr\""odinger operators on bounded Lipschitz domains, along with their
associated Weyl-Titchmarsh operators. Overall, this pushes the present state of
knowledge a significant step further. For example, we succeed in extending the
Dirichlet and Neumann trace operators in such a way that all self-adjoint
extensions of a Schr\""odinger operator on a bounded Lipschitz domain may be
described with explicit boundary conditions, thus providing a final answer to a
problem that has been investigated for more than 60 years in the mathematical
literature. Along the way, a number of other open problems are solved. The most
general geometric and analytic setting in which the theory developed here
yields satisfactory results is that of Lipschitz subdomains of Riemannian
manifolds and for the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator (in place of the
standard flat-space Laplacian). In particular, such an extension yields results
for variable coefficient Schr\""odinger operators on bounded Lipschitz domains."

$C$-Lipschitz. Phase retrieval appears in several applied circumstances,
ranging from crystallography to quantum mechanics.

integral operator $\mathscr{K}$ defined on two multi-intervals $J$ and $E$,
when the multi-intervals touch each other (but their interiors are disjoint).
The operator $\mathscr{K}$ is closely related to the multi-interval Finite
Hilbert Transform (FHT). This case can be viewed as a singular limit of
self-adjoint Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators with so-called integrable
kernels, where the limiting operator is still bounded, but has a continuous
spectral component. The regular case when $\text{dist}(J,E)>0$, and
$\mathscr{K}$ is of the Hilbert-Schmidt class, was studied in an earlier paper
by the authors. The main assumption in this paper is that $U=J\cup E$ is a
single interval. We show that the eigenvalues of $\mathscr{K}$, if they exist,
do not accumulate at $\lambda=0$. Combined with the results in an earlier paper
by the authors, this implies that $H_p$, the subspace of discontinuity (the
span of all eigenfunctions) of $\mathscr{K}$, is finite dimensional and
consists of functions that are smooth in the interiors of $J$ and $E$. We also
obtain an approximation to the kernel of the unitary transformation that
diagonalizes $\mathscr{K}$, and obtain a precise estimate of the exponential
instability of inverting $\mathscr{K}$. Our work is based on the method of

consecutive terms of a sequence approaching zero, is examined in this study.
Functions that take sequences satisfying this condition to sequences satisfying
the same condition are called s-ward continuous. Inclusion theorems that are
related to this kind of uniform continuity and continuity are also considered.
Additionally, the concept of $s$-ward compactness of a subset of $X$ via
$s$-quasi-Cauchy sequences are investigated. One finds out that the uniform
limit of any sequence of $s$-ward continuous function is $s$-ward continuous
and the set of $s$-ward continuous functions is a closed subset of the set of
continuous functions."

Curbera'), arxiv.Result.Author('Susumu Okada'), arxiv.Result.Author('Werner J. Ricker')]","The finite Hilbert transform T is a singular integral operator which maps the
Zygmund space $LlogL:=LlogL(-1,1)$ continuously into $L^1:=L^1(-1,1)$. By
extending the Parseval and Poincar\'e-Bertrand formulae to this setting, it is
possible to establish an inversion result needed for solving the airfoil
equation $T(f)=g$ whenever the data function $g$ lies in the range of $T$
within $L^1$ (shown to contain $LlogL$). Until now this was only known for $g$
belonging to the union of all $L^p$ spaces with $p>1$. It is established (due
to a result of Stein) that $T$ cannot be extended to any domain space beyond
$LlogL$ whilst still taking its values in $L^1$, i.e., $T:LlogL\to L^1$ is
optimally defined."

involved integral constructions and formulate lemmas giving us a tool for further study.","First of all, we consider statements with the necessary reﬁnement caused by the in-
volved functions, here we should note that a particular case corresponding to a power function
ϕ was considered by Lidskii [16].","As a
main result, we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for an abstract fractional evolution

corresponding to the Taylor series representing the function of the complex
variable. In previous papers, we considered the case when a function has a
decomposition in the Laurent series with the infinite principal part and finite
regular part. Our central challenge is to improve this result having considered
as a regular part an entire function satisfying the special condition of the
growth regularity. As an application we consider an opportunity to broaden the
conditions imposed upon the second term not containing the time variable of the
evolution equation in the abstract Hilbert space."
15218,"Although we will not proceed along this
line — it goes beyond the purpose of the present paper — it seems that a possible
version of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 4.1 involving a pair of distinct jointly uniform
