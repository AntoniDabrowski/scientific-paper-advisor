combinatorial optimization problems. We present a dynamical solver for the
Ising problem that is comprised of a network of coupled parametric oscillators
and show that it implements Lagrange multiplier constrained optimization. We
show that the pump depletion effect, which is intrinsic to parametric
oscillators, enforces binary constraints and enables the system's continuous
analog variables to converge to the optimal binary solutions to the
optimization problem. Moreover, there is an exact correspondence between the
equations of motion for the coupled oscillators and the update rules in the
primal-dual method of Lagrange multipliers. Though our analysis is performed
using electrical LC oscillators, it can be generalized to any system of coupled
parametric oscillators. We simulate the dynamics of the coupled oscillator
system and demonstrate that the performance of the solver on a set of benchmark
problems is comparable to the best-known results obtained by digital algorithms
in the literature."

Clinkinbeard'), arxiv.Result.Author('Prof. Nicole N. Hashemi')]","To improve predictive models for STEM applications, supplemental
physics-based features computed from input parameters are introduced into
single and multiple layers of a deep neural network (DNN). While many studies
focus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or
numerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified
relationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates
simply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate
dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural
frequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven
DNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from
simplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate
weight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus. To better understand the
benefit to model accuracy, these additional features are injected into various
single and multiple DNN layers, and trained with four different dataset sizes.
When these physics-enhanced models are evaluated against independent data of
the same materials and similar dimensions to the training sets, supplementation
with simplified physics-based parameters provides little reduction in
prediction error over the baseline for models trained with dataset sizes of 60
and greater, although small improvement from 19.3% to 16.1% occurs when trained
with a sparse size of 30. Conversely, notable accuracy gains occur when the
independent test data is of material and dimensions not conforming to the
training set. Specifically, when physics-enhanced data is injected into
multiple DNN layers, reductions in error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%,
35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for training dataset sizes of
261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating attainment of a degree of
generalizability."

Therefore, it is imperative to look for a new architecture capable of

the human brain is the most compact and energy-efficient intelligent device
known, it was intuitive to attempt to build an architecture that could mimic
our brain, and so the chase for neuromorphic computing began. While relentless
research has been underway for years to minimize the power consumption in
neuromorphic hardware, we are still a long way off from reaching the energy
efficiency of the human brain. Besides, design complexity, process variation,

Recently, the concept of implementing neuromorphic computing systems in
cryogenic temperature has garnered immense attention. Several cryogenic devices

areal density for hard disk drive (HDD) over the conventional magnetic
recording (CMR) technology. IMR-based HDD interlaces top tracks and bottom
tracks, where each bottom track is overlapped with two neighboring top tracks.
Thus, top tracks can be updated without restraint, whereas bottom tracks can be
updated by the time-consuming read-modify-write (RMW) or other novel update
strategy. Therefore, the layout of the tracks between the IMR-based HDD and the
CMR-based HDD is much different. Unfortunately, there has been no related disk
simulator and product available to the public, which motivates us to develop an
open-source IMR disk simulator to provide a platform for further research. We
implement the first public IMR disk simulator, called IMRSim, as a block device
driver in the Linux kernel, simulating the interlaced tracks and implementing
many state-of-the-art data placement strategies. IMRSim is built on the actual
CMR-based HDD to precisely simulate the I/O performance of IMR drives. While
I/O operations in CMR-based HDD are easy to visualize, update strategy and
multi-stage allocation strategy in IMR are inherently dynamic. Therefore, we
further graphically demonstrate how IMRSim processes I/O requests in the
visualization mode. We release IMRSim as an open-source IMR disk simulation
tool and hope to attract more scholars into related research on IMR technology."
