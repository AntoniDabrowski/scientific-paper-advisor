11 Conclusion and further research

In this paper, we proposed a generalization of the rBergomi model, where the change
of measure is stochastic and written in terms of a regime-switching fractional Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck process.","We see that the Control Variate method
substantially decreases the variance compared to the simple Monte Carlo, and the
MCVR further decreases the variance of the Control Variate method.","From the semi-closed expression for the solution of the fractional
SDE, we obtain a semi-closed form for the conditional moment generating function,
which in turn lets us obtain a semi-closed expression for the VIX.",2022-01-25 15:21:24+00:00,VIX pricing in the rBergomi model under a regime switching change of measure,q-fin.PR,"['q-fin.PR', '60G22, 60J28, 91G20, 60J20, 91G60, 45D05']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Henrique Guerreiro'), arxiv.Result.Author('João Guerra')]","The rBergomi model under the physical measure consists of modeling the

instrument pricing. As such various pricing approaches have been proposed, but
none treat the uncertainty in catastrophe occurrences and interest rates in a
sufficiently flexible and statistically reliable way within a unifying asset
pricing framework. Consequently, little is known empirically about the expected
risk-premia of CAT bonds. The primary contribution of this paper is to present
a unified Bayesian CAT bond pricing framework based on uncertainty
quantification of catastrophes and interest rates. Our framework allows for
complex beliefs about catastrophe risks to capture the distinct and common
patterns in catastrophe occurrences, and when combined with stochastic interest
rates, yields a unified asset pricing approach with informative expected risk
premia. Specifically, using a modified collective risk model -- Dirichlet
Prior-Hierarchical Bayesian Collective Risk Model (DP-HBCRM) framework -- we
model catastrophe risk via a model-based clustering approach. Interest rate
risk is modeled as a CIR process under the Bayesian approach. As a consequence
of casting CAT pricing models into our framework, we evaluate the price and
expected risk premia of various CAT bond contracts corresponding to clustering
of catastrophe risk profiles. Numerical experiments show how these clusters
reveal how CAT bond prices and expected risk premia relate to claim frequency
and loss severity."

1 Introduction

Futures are the most liquid contracts in commodity markets, hence they are the main tool to
gain exposure on the underlying commodities.",.,"As futures expire on a ﬁxed date, if a trader
wants to maintain exposure to price changes of the underlying commodity, he/she needs to
replace his/her current position on near-term expiring futures with a new position on futures
with longer maturities.",2022-08-02 07:25:20+00:00,Pricing commodity index options,q-fin.PR,"['q-fin.PR', 'q-fin.CP']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Alberto Manzano'), arxiv.Result.Author('Emanuele Nastasi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrea Pallavicini'), arxiv.Result.Author('Carlos Vázquez')]","We present a stochastic local volatility model for derivative contracts on
