2300,"The work of Heppes
inspired further research.","Using appropriate weights he could prove, besides the incircles
of the tiling (4, 4, 8), the solidity of several other packings.","Weighted density of packings has also been studied for
its own sake (see Ha´rs [1990, 1992]).",2022-02-22 10:35:03+00:00,Ball packings in hyperbolic space,math.MG,['math.MG'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Gábor Fejes Tóth'), arxiv.Result.Author('Lázló Fejes Tóth'), arxiv.Result.Author('Włodzimierz.

Early development in the study of packing and covering in high dimensions was
motivated by the geometry of numbers. Subsequent results, such as the discovery
of the Leech lattice and the linear programming bound, which culminated in the
recent solution of the sphere packing problem in dimensions 8 and 24, were
influenced by coding theory. After mentioning the known results concerning
existence of economical packings and coverings we discuss the different methods
yielding upper bounds for the density of packing congruent balls. We summarize
the few results on upper bounds for the packing density of general convex
bodies. The paper closes with some remarks on the structure of optimal
arrangements."

this paper we study variations of the Hopf theorem concerning continuous maps
of a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We
investigate the case of maps $f\colon M \to \mathbb{R}^m$ with $n < m$ and
introduce several notions of varied types of $f$-neighbors, which is a pair of
distinct points in $M$ such that $f$ takes it to a 'small' set of some type.
Next for each type, we ask what distances on $M$ are realized as distances
between $f$-neighbors of this type and study various characteristics of this
set of distances. One of our main results is as follows. Let $f\colon M \to
\mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a continuous map. We say that two distinct points $a$ and
$b$ in $M$ are visual $f$-neighbors if the segment in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ with
endpoints $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ intersects $f(M)$ only at $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then
the set of distances that are realized as distances between visual
$f$-neighbors is infinite. Besides we generalize the Hopf theorem in a
