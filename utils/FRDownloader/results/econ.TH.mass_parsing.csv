measures, which will be called simultaneous mass transport. The new framework
is motivated by the need to transport resources of different types
simultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations.
In terms of matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers and sellers,
by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the same time. The
mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very different from the
classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many new challenges. The Monge
and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted and connected. Existence and
uniqueness of the simultaneous transport and duality formulas are established,
and a notion of Wasserstein distance in this setting is introduced.In
particular, the duality theorem gives rise to a labour market equilibrium model
where each worker has several types of skills and each firm seeks to employ
these skills at different levels."

extreme case of marginalism while the Equal Division rule is an extreme case of

real life situations neither of them is a good fit for the fair distribution of
resources as the society is neither devoid of solidarity nor it can be
indifferent to rewarding the relatively more productive players. Thus a
trade-off between these two extreme cases has caught attention from many
researchers. In this paper, we obtain a new value for cooperative games with
transferable utilities that adopts egalitarianism in smaller coalitions on one
hand and on the other hand takes care of the players' marginal productivity in
sufficiently large coalitions. Our value is identical with the Shapley value on

2.1 Results from dynamics models

2.1.1 The eigen mode of the evolutionary dynamics

To investigate the dynamic behaviors in laboratory experiment game, we begin with using the

replicator dynamics equations [15]:

                                     x˙ i = xi(Ui − U )              (4)

game experiments reported [20].",2022-03-28 12:02:13+00:00,Dynamic Structure in Four-strategy Game: Theory and Experiment,econ.TH,"['econ.TH', 'nlin.CD']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Zhijian Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Shujie Zhou'), arxiv.Result.Author('Qinmei Yao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yijia Wang')]","Game dynamics theory, as a field of science, the consistency of theory and
experiment is essential. In the past 10 years, important progress has been made
in the merging of the theory and experiment in this field, in which dynamics
cycle is the presentation. However, the merging works have not got rid of the
constraints of Euclidean two-dimensional cycle so far. This paper uses a
classic four-strategy game to study the dynamic structure (non-Euclidean
superplane cycle). The consistency is in significant between the three ways:
(1) the analytical results from evolutionary dynamics equations, (2)
agent-based simulation results from learning models and (3) laboratory results
from human subjects game experiments. The consistency suggests that, game
dynamic structure could be quantitatively predictable, observable and
controllable in general."
6545,"This suggests an avenue for further research concerning the question of how to
manage information ﬂow in dynamic mechanisms.","In this paper, the concept of information ﬂow plays a central role in enabling the identiﬁ-
cation of a gradual mechanism with its unique informationally equivalent immediate gradual
mechanism.","In this regard, issues involving privacy,
conﬁdentiality, credibility, and trust appear pertinent.",2022-05-22 15:02:26+00:00,Information Design of Dynamic Mechanisms,econ.TH,['econ.TH'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Soo Hong Chew'), arxiv.Result.Author('Wenqian Wang')]","Two dynamic game forms are said to be behaviorally equivalent if they share
the ""same"" profiles of structurally reduced strategies (Battigalli et al.,
2020). In the context of dynamic implementation, behaviorally equivalent game
forms are interchangeable under a wide range of solution concepts for the
purpose of implementing a social choice function. A gradual mechanism (Chew and
Wang, 2022), which designs a procedure of information transmission mediated by
a central administrator, enables a formal definition of information flow. We
provide a characterization of behavioral equivalence between gradual mechanisms
in terms of their informational equivalence -- each agent is designed the
""same"" information flow. Information flow also helps in defining an intuitive
notion of immediacy for gradual mechanisms which is equivalent to their game
structures being minimal. Given that the class of gradual mechanisms serves as
a revelation principle for dynamic implementation (Li, 2017; Akbarpour and Li,
2020; Mackenzie, 2020; Chew and Wang, 2022), the class of immediate gradual
mechanisms provides a refined revelation principle."

utilities of players on a network and weights on the links that connect
players. The welfare-maximizing joint intervention exhibits the following
properties: (a) when the planner's budget is moderate (so that optimal
interventions are interior), the change in weight on any link connecting a pair
of players is proportional to the product of eigen-centralities of the pair;
(b) when the budget is sufficiently large, the optimal network takes a simple
form: It is either a complete network under strategic complements or a complete
balanced bipartite network under strategic substitutes. We show that the
welfare effect of joint intervention is shaped by the principal eigenvalue,
while the distributional effect is captured by the dispersion of the
corresponding eigenvalues, i.e., the eigen-centralities. Comparing joint
intervention in our setting with single intervention solely on the standalone
marginal utilities, as studied by Galeotti et al. (2020), we find that joint
intervention always yields a higher aggregate welfare, but may lead to greater
inequality, which highlights a possible trade-off between the welfare and
distributional impacts of joint intervention."

approaches come to mind.",2022-07-07 16:04:55+00:00,Asset Trading in Continuous Time: A Cautionary Tale,econ.TH,['econ.TH'],[arxiv.Result.Author('William R. Zame')],"The continuous time model of dynamic asset trading is the central model of
modern finance. Because trading cannot in fact take place at every moment of
time, it would seem desirable to show that the continuous time model can be
viewed as the limit of models in which trading can occur only at (many)
discrete moments of time. This paper demonstrates that, if we take terminal
wealth constraints and self-financing constraints as seriously in the discrete
model as in the continuous model, then the continuous trading model need not be
the limit of discrete trading models. This raises serious foundational
questions about the continuous time model."
11263,"Finally, it might be valuable to further study what precisely hinders equilibration in the ‘low
values treatment’ investigated in this paper.","(2007) and
others may prove highly relevant.","We have informally sketched two alternatives:
that buyers reject equilibrium oﬀers on the (mistaken) belief that they allocate almost all
the surplus to sellers, or otherwise that buyers reject these oﬀers strategically as a means
of generating higher oﬀers in subsequent rounds.",2022-09-15 12:22:21+00:00,Competitive equilibrium and the double auction,econ.TH,['econ.TH'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Itzhak Rasooly')],"In this paper, we revisit the common claim that double auctions necessarily
generate competitive equilibria. We begin by observing that competitive
equilibrium has some counterintuitive implications: specifically, it predicts
that monotone shifts in the value distribution can leave prices unchanged.
Using experiments, we then test whether these implications are borne out by the
data. We find that in double auctions with stationary value distributions, the
resulting prices can be far from competitive equilibria. We also show that the
effectiveness of our counterexamples is blunted when traders can leave without
replacement as time progresses. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
`Marshallian path' is crucial for generating equilibrium prices in double
auctions."
11759,"A potentially
fruitful avenue for further research would be to consider more carefully the contract-
ing problem in a setting where the principal and the agent have misaligned beliefs
and/or preferences, and to investigate how contracting can build upon the inherent
beneﬁts of misalignment.",Our analysis focuses on misalignment and away from contracting.,"Further, due to the added complexity of rational inattention models, we conﬁne
our exploration to a discrete state-matching model, which strays away from the
continuous models more commonly used in delegation problems.",2022-09-27 21:03:58+00:00,Optimally Biased Expertise,econ.TH,['econ.TH'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Pavel Ilinov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Andrei Matveenko'), arxiv.Result.Author('Maxim Senkov'), arxiv.Result.Author('Egor Starkov')]","This paper shows that the principal can strictly benefit from delegating a
decision to an agent whose opinion differs from that of the principal. We
consider a ""delegated expertise"" problem, in which the agent has an advantage
in information acquisition relative to the principal, as opposed to having
preexisting private information. When the principal is ex ante predisposed
towards some action, it is optimal for her to hire an agent who is predisposed
towards the same action, but to a smaller extent, since such an agent would
acquire more information, which outweighs the bias stemming from misalignment.

instrument in delegation, performing on par with contracting and communication
