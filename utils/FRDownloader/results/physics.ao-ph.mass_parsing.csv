to the mesoscale eddy energy dissipation time-scale. Within the context of a
global ocean circulation model with an energy constrained mesoscale eddy

the soil moisture-precipitation feedback processes over the Indian region, the
present study investigates the impact of soil moisture-temperature (SM-T)
coupling on the temperature extremes (ExT) using the high-resolution (~60 km)
model simulations. These simulations include the control and soil moisture (SM)
sensitivity experiments (DRY-SM and WET-SM) initialized by perturbing
(decreasing/increasing) SM from the historical (HIST: 1951-2010) and future 4K
warming (FUT: 2051-2100) control runs. The analysis identifies the transitional
regions of north-central India (NCI) as the hotspot of strong SM-T coupling.
Over NCI, the HIST experiment shows an occurrence of 4-5 extreme events per
year, with an average duration of 5-6 days per event and intensity exceeding
46oC. Whereas, FUT estimates indicate relatively severe, long-lasting, and more
frequent extreme events. The SM sensitivity experiments reveal the significant
influence of SM-T coupling on the ExT over NCI in both historical and future
climates. We find that the DRY-SM results in significant enhancement of
frequency, duration and intensity of ExT, in contrast to WET-SM. We note that
the difference between DRY-SM and WET-SM 50-year return value of the block
maxima GEV fit can reach upto 1.25oC and 3oC for historical and future climate,
respectively. The enhanced (reduced) extreme temperature conditions in DRY-SM
(WET-SM) simulation are caused by the intensification (abridgement) of sensible
heat flux by limiting (intensifying) available total energy for evaporative
cooling due to faster (slower) dissipation of positive soil moisture anomalies
(also called as soil moisture memory). In addition, the influence of SM on ExT
over NCI is found to be larger during the post-monsoon season as compared to
the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons."

in rigid body dynamics but also served as the foundation of low-order models of
many naturally occurring systems. It is well known that VG possesses two
invariants, or constants of motion, corresponding to kinetic energy and squared
angular momentum, giving oscillatory solutions to its equations of motion. Nine
distinct subclasses of the VG have been identified, two of which the Euler
gyroscope and Lorenz gyrostat are each known to have two constants. This paper
provides a complete characterization of constants of motion of the VG and its
subclasses, showing how these enjoy two constants of motion even when rendered
in terms of a non-invertible transformation of parameters, leading to a
transformed Volterra gyrostat (tVG). If the quadratic coefficients of the tVG
sum to zero, as they do for the VG, the system conserves energy. In all of
these cases, the flows preserve volume; however, physical models where the
quadratic coefficients do not sum to zero are ubiquitous, and characterization
of constants of motion and the resulting dynamics for this more general class
of models with volume conservation but without energy conservation is lacking.
We provide such a characterization for each of the subclasses. Those with three
linear feedback terms have no constants of motion, and thereby admit rich
dynamics including chaos. This gives rise to a broad class of three-dimensional
volume conserving chaotic flows, arising naturally from model reduction
techniques."

non-precipitating trade-wind boundary layer. Here, we summarise how this role
also explains the spontaneous growth of mesoscale ($>O(10)$ km) fluctuations in
clouds and moisture around the mean state in a minimal-physics, large-eddy
simulation of the undisturbed period during BOMEX on a large ($O(100)$ km)
domain. Small, spatial anomalies in latent heating in cumulus clouds, which
form on top of small moisture fluctuations, give rise to circulations that
transport moisture, but not heat, from dry to moist regions, and thus reinforce
the latent heating anomaly. We frame this positive feedback as a linear
instability in mesoscale moisture fluctuations, whose time-scale depends only
on i) a vertical velocity scale and ii) the mean environment's vertical
structure. In our minimal-physics setting, we show both ingredients are
provided by the shallow cumulus convection itself: It is intrinsically unstable
to length scale growth. The upshot is that energy released by clouds at
kilometre scales may play a more profound and direct role in shaping the
mesoscale trade-wind environment than is generally appreciated, motivating
further research into the mechanism's relevance."

non-precipitating trade-wind boundary layer. Here, we summarise how this role
also explains the spontaneous growth of mesoscale ($>O(10)$ km) fluctuations in
clouds and moisture around the mean state in a minimal-physics, large-eddy
simulation of the undisturbed period during BOMEX on a large ($O(100)$ km)
domain. Small, spatial anomalies in latent heating in cumulus clouds, which
form on top of small moisture fluctuations, give rise to circulations that
transport moisture, but not heat, from dry to moist regions, and thus reinforce
the latent heating anomaly. We frame this positive feedback as a linear
instability in mesoscale moisture fluctuations, whose time-scale depends only
on i) a vertical velocity scale and ii) the mean environment's vertical
structure. In our minimal-physics setting, we show both ingredients are
provided by the shallow cumulus convection itself: It is intrinsically unstable
to length scale growth. The upshot is that energy released by clouds at
kilometre scales may play a more profound and direct role in shaping the
mesoscale trade-wind environment than is generally appreciated, motivating
further research into the mechanism's relevance."

numerical weather forecasting over short timescales. However the applicability
of these reduced precision techniques to longer timescale climate simulations -
especially those which seek to describe a dynamical, changing climate - remains
unclear. We investigate this question by deploying a global atmospheric, coarse
resolution model known as SPEEDY to simulate a changing climate system subject
to increased $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations, over a 100 year timescale. Whilst
double precision is typically the operational standard for climate modelling,
we find that reduced precision solutions (Float32, Float16) are sufficiently
accurate. Rounding the finite precision floats stochastically, rather than
using the more common ``round-to-nearest"" technique, notably improves the
performance of the reduced precision solutions. Over 100 years the mean bias
error (MBE) in the global mean surface temperature (precipitation) relative to
the double precision solution is $+2 \times 10^{-4}$K ($-8 \times 10^{-5}$
mm/6hr) at single precision and $-3.5\times 10^{-2}$ K($-1 \times 10^{-2}$

the half precision error to +1.8 $\times 10^{-2}$ K ($-8 \times10^{-4}$

years, the difference in the expected value of the global surface temperature,
relative to the double precision solution is $\leq 5 \times 10^{-3}$ K and for
precipitation $8 \times 10^{-4}$ mm/6h when numerically integrating at half
precision with stochastic rounding. Areas of the model which notably improve
due to the inclusion of stochastic over deterministic rounding are also

and its recent 21st century acceleration in the satellite record. At regional
scale, the evolution of sea level probability distributions is often assumed to
be dominated by changes in the mean. However, a quantification of changes in
distributional shapes in a changing climate is currently missing. To this end,
we propose a novel framework quantifying significant changes in probability
distributions from time series data. The framework first quantifies linear
trends in quantiles through quantile regression. Quantile slopes are then
projected onto a set of four $orthogonal$ polynomials quantifying how such
changes can be explained by $independent$ shifts in the first four statistical
moments. The framework proposed is theoretically founded, general and can be
applied to any climate observable with close-to-linear changes in
distributions. We focus on observations and a coupled climate model (GFDL-CM4).
In the historical period, trends in coastal daily sea level have been driven
mainly by changes in the mean and can therefore be explained by a shift of the
distribution with no change in shape. In the modeled world, robust changes in
higher order moments emerge with increasing $\text{CO}_{2}$ concentration. Such
changes are driven in part by ocean circulation alone and get amplified by sea
level pressure fluctuations, with possible consequences for sea level extremes

representing relevant physical processes, and is supported by a chemistry
scheme that reflects our current understanding of chemical processes in the

chemiluminescence effects resulting from the vibrationally excited NO produced

parameterized treatment of photoelectron effects as secondary heating sources.
The energy inputs are balanced by radiative losses from the neutral
thermosphere in the form of infrared emissions from CO$_2$, NO and O($^3$P).
Atmospheric profiles are generated for a solar cycle, and are compared with
empirical model results as well as observational data. On average, calculated

above 1000 m in the winter half year. A possible explanation in line with the
seasonality of the bias is that snow cover may be misinterpreted as clouds at
higher altitudes."

for intra-day forecasts of solar resources and photovoltaic power generation.
Intra-day SSR forecasts are of interest to power traders and to operators of
solar plants and power grids who seek to optimize their revenues and maintain
the grid stability by matching power supply and demand. Our study analyzes
systematic biases and the uncertainty of SSR estimates derived from Meteosat
with the SARAH-2 and HelioMont algorithms at intra-hour and intra-day time
scales. The satellite SSR estimates are analyzed based on 136 ground stations
across altitudes from 200 m to 3570 m Switzerland in 2018. We find major biases
and uncertainties in the instantaneous, hourly and daily-mean SSR. In peak
daytime periods, the instantaneous satellite SSR deviates from the
ground-measured SSR by a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 110.4 and 99.6 W/m2
for SARAH-2 and HelioMont, respectively. For the daytime SSR, the
instantaneous, hourly and daily-mean MADs amount to 91.7, 81.1, 50.8 and 82.5,
66.7, 42.9 W/m2 for SARAH-2 and HelioMont, respectively. Further, the SARAH-2
instantaneous SSR drastically underestimates the solar resources at altitudes
above 1000 m in the winter half year. A possible explanation in line with the
seasonality of the bias is that snow cover may be misinterpreted as clouds at
higher altitudes."
