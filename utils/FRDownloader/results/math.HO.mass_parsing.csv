4262,We invite further research on these connections.,"Toposes provide new impetus to study constructive mathematics and intuitionistic
   logic, in particular also to restrict to intuitionistic logic on the meta level and to
   consider the idea that the platonic heaven might be governed by intuitionistic logic.","We intend this contribution to be self-contained and do not assume familiarity

in philosophy of mathematics in mind.",2022-04-02 22:41:52+00:00,Exploring mathematical objects from custom-tailored mathematical universes,math.HO,"['math.HO', 'math.CT', 'math.LO', '03-02, 00A30']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Ingo Blechschmidt')],"Toposes can be pictured as mathematical universes. Besides the standard
topos, in which most of mathematics unfolds, there is a colorful host of
alternate toposes in which mathematics plays out slightly differently. For
instance, there are toposes in which the axiom of choice and the intermediate
value theorem from undergraduate calculus fail. The purpose of this
contribution is to give a glimpse of the toposophic landscape, presenting
several specific toposes and exploring their peculiar properties, and to
explicate how toposes provide distinct lenses through which the usual
mathematical objects of the standard topos can be viewed."
8025,"Moreover, the lectures motivated them to want to understand the material, and a high-level
overview served as a structure guiding further study to unpack logical details.","The attendees were convinced that the lectures were invaluable
to them because they provided a roadmap outlining the central ideas of the theory, helped direct their
attention to what was important and explained the utility of the technical tools used to develop the
theory.","The authors concluded
that further studies are warranted to investigate the function of lectures in enabling effective learning.",2022-06-24 08:20:48+00:00,Traditional lectures versus active learning -- a false dichotomy?,math.HO,"['math.HO', '97-02']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Heiko Dietrich'), arxiv.Result.Author('Tanya Evans')]","Traditional lectures are commonly understood to be a teacher-centered mode of
instruction where the main aim is a provision of explanations by an educator to
the students. Recent literature in higher education overwhelmingly depicts this
mode of instruction as inferior compared to the desired student-centered models
based on active learning techniques. First, using a four-quadrant model of
educational environments, we address common confusion related to a conflation
of two prevalent dichotomies by focusing on two key dimensions: (1) the extent
to which students are prompted to engage actively and (2) the extent to which
expert explanations are provided. Second, using a case study, we describe an
evolution of tertiary mathematics education, showing how traditional
instruction can still play a valuable role, provided it is suitably embedded in
a student-centered course design. We support our argument by analyzing the
teaching practice and learning environment in a third-year abstract algebra
course through the lens of Stanislav Dehaene's theoretical framework for
effective teaching and learning. The framework, comprising ""four pillars of
learning"", is based on a state-of-the-art conception of how learning can be
facilitated according to cognitive science, educational psychology, and
neuroscience findings. In the case study, we illustrate how, over time, the
unit design and the teaching approach have evolved into a learning environment
that aligns with the four pillars of learning. We conclude that traditional
lectures can and do evolve to optimize learning environments and that the
erection of the dichotomy ""traditional instruction versus active learning"" is
no longer relevant."
8027,"Therefore, inquiry-based education should not be promoted for general adoption in
mathematics undergraduate education without further research.","In summary,
the claim that students should be allowed to discover mathematics for themselves akin to
professional mathematicians conflicts with a large body of research supported by experimental
evidence.","Our recommendation, instead, is
to consider ways to promote active (cognitive) engagement of learners in a conventional
mathematics lecture.",2022-06-24 08:28:51+00:00,Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education: a call for reform in tertiary education seems unjustified,math.HO,"['math.HO', '97-02']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Tanya Evans'), arxiv.Result.Author('Heiko Dietrich')]","In the last decade, major efforts have been made to promote inquiry-based
mathematics learning at the tertiary level. The Inquiry-Based Mathematics
Education (IBME) movement has gained strong momentum among some mathematicians,
attracting substantial funding, including from some US government agencies.
This resulted in the successful mobilization of regional consortia in many
states, uniting over 800 mathematics education practitioners working to reform
undergraduate education. Inquiry-based learning is characterized by the
fundamental premise that learners should be allowed to learn 'new to them'
mathematics without being taught. This progressive idea is based on the
assumption that it is best to advance learners to the level of experts by
engaging learners in mathematical practices similar to those of practising
mathematicians: creating new definitions, conjectures and proofs - that way
learners are thought to develop 'deep mathematical understanding'. However,
concerted efforts to radically reform mathematics education must be
systematically scrutinized in view of available evidence and theoretical
advances in the learning sciences. To that end, this scoping review sought to
consolidate the extant research literature from cognitive science and
educational psychology, offering a critical commentary on the effectiveness of
inquiry-based learning. Our analysis of research articles and books pertaining
to the topic revealed that the call for a major reform by the IBME advocates is
not justified. Specifically, the general claim that students would learn better
(and acquire superior conceptual understanding) if they were not taught is not
supported by evidence. Neither is the general claim about the merits of IBME
for addressing equity issues in mathematics classrooms."

specialties seeking to get started on homological algebra, covering the
necessary central topics to later delve deeper into more complex aspects of
this field and beyond. This work starts by presenting the notion of chain
complexes of algebraic structures, and then moves into exploring homology
modules and chain homotopies. Next, we provide an overview of projective
resolutions and conclude by entering the world of category theory by looking at
Tor functors."
