modern communication and sensing systems. Contrary to the near-infrared/visible
regions, the fast and sensitive photodetectors operated at room temperature for
the far-infrared/terahertz regions are not well developed despite a possibly
vast range of applications. The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in single-phase
noncentrosymmetric materials based on the shift current mechanism enables
less-dissipative energy conversion endowed with instantaneous responsivity
owing to the quantum-mechanical geometric phase of electronic states.
Nevertheless, the small-band-gap material for the low-energy BPVE inevitably
suffers from the thermal noise due to the intrinsically high conductivity.
Here, we demonstrate the shift current induced by soft-phonon excitations
without creation of electron-hole pairs in the archetypal ferroelectric BaTiO3
by using the terahertz light, whose energy scale is three orders of magnitude
smaller than the electronic band gap. At and above room temperature, we observe
appreciable photocurrents caused by the soft-phonon excitation as large as that
for electronic excitation and their strong phonon-mode dependence. The observed
phonon-driven BPVE can be well accounted for by the shift current model
considering the electron-phonon coupling in the displacement-type
ferroelectrics as supported by the first-principles calculation. Our findings
establish the efficient quantum BPVE arising from low-energy elementary
excitations, suggesting the novel principle for the high-performance terahertz
photodetectors."

is difficult to perform perturbative calculations due to the complexity caused
by the interplay of two interactions. When one or two interactions are strong,
ordinary perturbation theory may become invalid. Here we consider undoped
graphene as an example and provide a non-perturbative quantum-field-theoretic
analysis of the interplay of electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb
interaction. We treat these two interactions on an equal footing and derive the
exact Dyson-Schwinger integral equation of the full Dirac-fermion propagator.
This equation depends on several complicated correlation functions and thus is
difficult to handle. Fortunately, we find that these correlation functions obey
a number of exact identities, which allows us to prove that the Dyson-Schwinger
equation of the full fermion propagator is self-closed. After solving this
self-closed equation, we obtain the renormalized velocity of Dirac fermions and
show that its energy (momentum) dependence is dominantly determined by the
electron-phonon (Coulomb) interaction. In particular, the renormalized velocity
exhibits a logarithmic momentum dependence and a non-monotonic energy

channels of electrons compete to screen a spin-1/2 impurity, shows
overcompensation of the impurity spin, leading to the non-Fermi-liquid behavior
in various thermodynamic and transport properties. However, when the channel
symmetry is broken, an impurity quantum phase transition can occur at zero
temperature. Identification of an order parameter describing the impurity
quantum phase transition is very difficult since it is beyond the conventional
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory. By employing the natural orbitals
renormalization group method, we study both two-channel and threechannel Kondo
models, from the perspective of spin correlation between the impurity and
electrons in electronic channels. Here we demonstrate that by introducing the
spin-correlation ratio as an order parameter we can characterize impurity
quantum phase transitions driven by channel asymmetry. In particular, the
universal critical exponents $\beta$ of the spin-correlation ratio and $\nu$ of
the correlation length are explicitly determined by finite-sizescaling
analysis, namely, $\beta = 0.10(1), \nu = 2.0(1)$, and $\beta = 0.10(1), \nu =

We find that for the nickelate, like the cuprate, the stoichiometric compound
is antiferromagnetic. We find superconductivity in a doping range bounded, with
a small coexistence region, by the onset of antiferromagnetism at low doping
and with transition temperature becoming immeasurably small at high doping.
Superconductivity emerges at around the same hole doping for both compounds,
but requires a larger deviation from half filling for the nickelate. Both
antiferromagnetic and superconducting order lead to a partial gapping of the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface sheet. Our similar results for the cuprate and
nickelate suggest that nickelate superconductivity is cupratelike. We compare
our results to the experimental phase diagram."

construct operators to produce and move these excitations, and use these to
find the loop-loop and point-loop braiding relations. These creation operators
also reveal that some of the excitations are confined, costing energy to
separate. This is discussed in the context of condensation/confinement
transitions between different cases of this model. We also discuss the
topological charges of the model and use explicit measurement operators to
re-derive a relationship between the number of charges measured by a 2-torus

$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid. This $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid is of relevance to
the spin $S=1/2$ square lattice antiferromagnet, where recent numerical studies
have given evidence for such a phase existing in the regime of high frustration
between nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic
interactions (the $J_1$-$J_2$ model), appearing in a parameter regime between
the vanishing of N\'eel order and the onset of valence bond solid ordering. The
proximate Dirac spin liquid is unstable to monopole proliferation on the square
lattice, ultimately leading to N\'eel or valence bond solid ordering. As such,
we conjecture that this Higgs transition describes the critical theory
separating the gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid of the $J_1$-$J_2$ model from
one of the two proximate ordered phases. The transition into the other ordered
phase can be described in a unified manner via a transition into an unstable
SU(2) spin liquid, which we have analyzed in prior work. By studying the
deconfined critical theory separating the U(1) Dirac spin liquid from the
gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid in a $1/N_f$ expansion, with $N_f$
proportional to the number of fermions, we find a stable fixed point with an
anisotropic spinon dispersion and a dynamical critical exponent $z \neq 1$. We
analyze the consequences of this anisotropic dispersion by calculating the

functions, and we find them to be distinct. We also note the influence of the

the Kagome antiferromagnet vesignieite BaCu$_{3}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$(OH)$_{2}$, we
have made systematic investigation of the phase diagram of the classical and
quantum $J_{1}-J_{3}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model defined on the Kagome
lattice(KAFHM). While it is shown previously that a large antiferromagnetic
exchange between the third-neighboring spins can drive an emergent $q=4$ Potts
order through the order-by-disorder mechanism, it is elusive what will happen
in the so called ""grey region"" where the Luttinger-Tisza criteria fails to
predict the classical ordering pattern. Through extensive Monte Carlo
simulation, we find that the ""grey region"" is characterized by competing
emergent $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts order, whose emergence are beyond the
description of the conventional order-by-disorder mechanism. Our Schwinger
Boson mean field calculation in the ""grey region"" confirms the existence of the
Potts-3 order in the ground state of quantum $J_{1}-J_{3}$ KAFHM. The predicted
Potts-3 state is found to take two different forms distinguished by their
projective symmetry group character(PSG or quantum order), although they have
exactly the same symmetry. A comparison with the exact diagonalization result
on a 36-site cluster shows that the ""grey region"" may indeed host a nematic
spin liquid ground state featuring an anisotropic ring structure around the
$\mathbf{q}=0$ point in its spinon dispersion relation. We find that such ""grey

playground to study the rich competition between exotic emergent phases, rather
than a burden on their theoretical analysis."

measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor $S(k,\omega)$. Here we
apply theoretically these ideas to the Hubbard chain away from the

weight in $S(k,\omega)$ going from the non-interacting limit ($U=0$) to the
strong coupling limit ($U\rightarrow \infty$), where it reduces to the
Heisenberg quantum spin chain. We use the density matrix renormalization group

QFI grows with $U$, becoming capable of witnessing bipartite entanglement above
$U=2.5$ (in units of the hopping), where it also changes slope. This point is
also proximate to slope changes of the bandwidth $W(U)$ and the half-chain von

Pr$_{0.85}$LaCe$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ (PLCCO) to revisit the electron-hole
asymmetry, which has been understood as a fundamental property of cuprates.
Four differently annealed samples - as-grown, reduced, optimally oxygenated,
and over-oxygenated samples - were prepared, which have superconducting
transition temperatures, $T_c$ = 0, 15, 24, and 18 K, respectively. We observed
that low-energy quasiparticle spectral weights of all the PLCCO samples are
significantly small in comparison with those of other electron-doped cuprate
families. Instead, they are rather close to those of hole-doped counterpart
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO). Accordingly, estimated effective carrier
numbers per Cu atom ($N_{\mathrm{eff}}$/Cu) of superconducting samples are also
considerably small, despite their relatively high critical temperatures.
Complementary photoemission study reveals that the low-energy quasiparticle
spectral weight of PLCCO is much smaller than that of
Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ (NCCO), consistent with the optical
results. Our observations demonstrate that PLCCO provides the electron-hole

topological surface states. We observe exceptional non-saturated linear
magnetoresistance which results from Dirac fermions inhabiting the lowest
Landau level in the quantum limit. The transverse magnetoresistance changes
from a semi-classical weak-field $B^{2}$ dependence to a high-field $B$
dependence at a critical field $B^{\star}$. It is found that $B^{\star} \propto
T^2$, which is expected from the Landau level splitting of a linear energy

anti-localization (WAL). These novel magnetotransport signatures evince the

material CeCoSi based on a self-consistent mean-field calculation for the
effective localized model. This material has two ordered phases in the
temperature-pressure phase diagram: the antiferromagnetic phase and the
nonmagnetic phase, the latter of which has been suggested to be an
antiferroquadrupolar phase. Meanwhile, the origin of the antiferroquadrupolar
phase has been unclear, since a quadrupole degree of freedom is present only
between the ground-state level and highly separated excited-state level under a
tetragonal crystalline electric field (CEF), whose energy scale is much larger
than the transition temperature. To understand the sequence of the phase
transition from the paramagnetic phase, antiferroquadrupolar phase, and
antiferromagnetic phase when decreasing the temperature, we examine the
important interaction parameters in the effective localized model. We clarify
that the $3z^2-r^2$-type of the antiferroquadrupolar interactions can
renormalize the CEF level splitting, which assists a quadrupolar ordering even
in a tetragonal system without orbital degeneracy. Moreover, the stability of
the antiferroquadrupolar and antiferromagnetic states in a magnetic field and
the behavior of the magnetic/quadrupolar susceptibility are also presented for
the information to identify the unknown order parameter in the nonmagnetic

the phase diagram, including the N\'{e}el phase, plaquette valence-bond-solid
phase, dimer valence-bond-solid phase and stripe antiferromagnetic phase. In
the N\'{e}el phase, besides the obvious renormalization of the magnon
dispersion, we find that the spectrum exhibits a dome-shaped broad continuum
around the second Brillouin zone (BZ) and the additional strong continuum close
to the corner of the BZ. In the valence-bond-solid phases, the spectra are
dominated by a strong broad continuum all the way down to below $J_1$
coexisting with the lowest-energy triplon modes characterizing the plaquette
and dimer phases. We ascribe this strong broad continuum and the additional
continuum close to the BZ corner in the N\'{e}el phase to the contributions of
fractionalized spinon excitations. In the stripe phase, a clear difference from
the linear spin wave approximation is that the spectrum is gapped at the $M$
point while that obtained by the latter is gapless due to the strong quantum
fluctuations. We point out that the features observed in the N\'{e}el phase are

in two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered material, Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$

transitions: paramagnetic to ferromagnetic at around $T_\text{C}$ $\sim$ 266 K
and another spin reorientation transition (SRT) at around $T_\text{SRT}$ $\sim
$ 100 K. The magnetization measurements shows a prominent thermal hysteresis in
proximity to $T_\text{SRT}$ at $H\parallel c$, which implies the first-order
nature of SRT. Reasonable MCE has been observed around both transition
temperatures ( at around $T_\text{C}$, -$\Delta$S$_M^\text{max}$ = 1.95 and
1.99 J.Kg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and at around $T_\text{SRT}$,

ab$ and $H\parallel c$ respectively) at 50 kOe magnetic field change. The above
results reveal higher MCE value at $T_\text{SRT}$ compared to the values of MCE
at $T_\text{C}$. The scaling analysis of MCE at $T_\text{C}$, shows that the
rescaled $\Delta$S$_M (T, H)$ follow a universal curve confirming the
second-order character of the ferromagnetic transition. The same scaling
analysis of MCE breaks down at $T_\text{SRT}$ suggesting that SRT is not a
second order phase transition. The exponent $n$ from field dependence of
magnetic entropy change presents a maximum of $|n|>2$ confirming the
first-order nature of SRT."

to study the itinerant near-ferromagnet MnSi, we find that the system's
fundamental magnetic units are interconnected, extended molecular orbitals
consisting of three Mn atoms each, rather than individual Mn atoms. This result
is further corroborated by magnetic Wannier orbitals obtained by ab initio
calculations. It contrasts the ionic picture with a concrete example, and
presents a novel regime of the spin waves where the wavelength is comparable to
the spatial extent of the molecular orbitals. Our discovery brings important
insights into not only the magnetism of MnSi, but also a broad range of

classical zero modes that are robust to many but not all distortions of the
Hamiltonian. It arises naturally from locality in systems whose interactions
form a set of constraints such as in geometrically frustrated magnets and balls
and springs metamaterials. For a magnet whose classical limit exhibits
topological frustration, an important question is what happens to this topology
when the degrees of freedom are quantized and whether such frustration could
lead to exotic quantum phases of matter like a spin liquid. We answer these
questions for a geometrically frustrated spin ladder model. It has the feature
of having infinitely many conserved quantities that aid the solution. We find
classical zero modes all get lifted by quantum fluctuations and the system is
left with a unique rung singlet ground state -- a trivial quantum spin liquid.
Moreover, we find low-energy eigenstates corresponding to known symmetry
protected topological (SPT) ground states, and a special role of $SU(2)$
symmetry, that it demands the existence of extra dimensions of classical zero
modes -- the phenomena we call symmetry-enriched topological frustration
(SETF). These results suggest small violations of the conservation laws in the
nearly SETF regime could lead to quantum scars. We further study a
two-dimensional bilayer triangular lattice model and find a similar SETF
phenomena which also leads to suppressed low-energy topological eigenstates in
the quantum regime. These results suggest that in the absence of magnetic
order, classical topological frustration manifests at finite spin as
asymptotically low energy modes with support for exotic quantum phenomena."

we also analyze the large-$N$ limit, where the fixed point moves to weak

spin-orbit coupling (SOC) yields a small in-plane orbital moment and
anisotropy. Indeed, by tracing a set of different spin-orbital states, our

that quenched outside disturbances have in an intermediately long time limit.
We consider localized imperfections, uniform fields, noise, and couplings to an
environment which we study in a unified framework using a prototypical but
idealized interacting quantum device - the Kitaev honeycomb model. Our study
focuses on the quantum state robustness in response to an outside magnetic
field, a magnetic bath, magnetic noise, magnetic impurities, and a noisy
impurity. As indicators for quantum robustness, we use the Uhlmann fidelty of
the ground state and excited spinon states after a quench. We find that the
time dependence of the fidelity often depends crucially on whether the system
is gapped. We find that in the gapped case the fidelity decays to a constant
value under noiseless quenches, while in a gapless system it exhibits algebraic
decay. In all other situations studied, such as coupling to a bath and noisy
quenches, both gapped and gapless systems exhibit a universal form for the
long-time fidelity, $Ce^{-\alpha t}t^{-\beta}$, where the values of $C$,
$\alpha$, and $\beta$ depend on physical parameters such as system size,
disturbance strength, etc. Therefore, our work provides estimates for the
intermediate-long time stability of a quantum device and it suggests under what
conditions there appear the hallmarks of an orthogonality catastrophe in the
time-dependence of the fidelity. Our work provides engineering guidelines for
quantum devices in quench design and system size."

susceptibility data in pure CeTiGe3 and CeVGe3 can be well explained by the CEF
model. The proposed CEF energy levels suggest that there is a gradual change of
the ground state from 5/2 state in CeTiGe3 to 1/2 state in CeVGe3, and a
suppression of CEF splitting energies near the quantum critical region. When
hydrostatic pressure is used instead of chemical substitution, the quantum
critical point is avoided by the appearance of magnetic phases above around 4.1
GPa. In the substitution study, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions
are well separated, whereas they touch in the pressure study. We observe a
different trend in the temperature dependence of the resistivity maximum in
both studies, suggesting that the CEF splitting energy is suppressed by V
substitution but enhanced by pressure. We also observe different responses in
lattice constants between the two studies, highlighting the fact that
substitution effects cannot be reduced to chemical pressure effects only.

rules for $3$D topological order in the framework of topological quantum field
theory (TQFT). Specially, we focus on a $3$D topological order featured with
the so-called Borromean rings braiding proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 121,
061601 (2018)]. We denote the system is equipped with Borromean rings
topological order if it supports Borromean rings braiding. Starting with the
TQFT action of Borromean rings topological order with
$G=\prod_{i}^{3}\mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$, gauge-invariant Wilson operators for
particle and loop excitations are constructed. Next, fusion rules of
topological excitations are studied in terms of path integrals. In this manner,
algebraic fusion rules are unveiled by down-to-earth field-theoretical
calculation. Among the fusion rules there exist non-Abelian ones. In addition,
shrinking rules for loop excitations are studied, which are consistent with the
fusion rules. Finally, the relation of fusion rules and combinations of

algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local
Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected
subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large ""thermal"" subspace
and the small ""non-thermal"" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of
unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this
unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking
phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use
the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the
exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS. We
illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2
ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic
$\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write
down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.
Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to
recover results of previous ""brute-force"" numerical searches for such
Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence
of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also
illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS
Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori
construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework
motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they
violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we
discuss its implications to dynamics."

reshaping of the Fermi surface, and a pseudogap regime at low doping in which
quasiparticle excitations are selectively destroyed near the antinodal regions

Anderson (2iA) model with two hosts coupled by spin exchange in the most
symmetric case there are either two phase transitions or none. The phases
comprise the conventional Kondo and RKKY regimes and a novel one, interpreted
as a Kondo-stabilized, metallic quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here we analyze how
various types of asymmetry affect this picture. We demonstrate that the
transitions are robust against the coupling and particle-hole asymmetries,
provided charge transfer is forbidden. This holds true despite the scattering
phase shift at each impurity taking non-universal values. Finally, for an
extended model including charge transfer between the hosts and a small Coulomb
interaction at the host sites directly coupled to impurities, we show that the
presence of charge transfer changes the phase transitions into crossovers.
Provided the inter-host hopping is sufficiently small, this leads to
qualitatively the same physics at non-zero temperature. The relevance of this
model for rare-earth atoms in a metallic host is discussed and potential
experimental setups for observing our findings are proposed."

compute its phase diagram. We find that both the Goldstone and area law phases
persist in this new phase diagram, but with a shifted phase boundary. One
important qualitative aspect of the new phase boundary is that even for the
case of commuting measurements, the Goldstone phase persists up to a finite
non-zero measurement rate. This is in contrast with the CPLC, in which
non-commuting measurements are necessary for realizing the Goldstone phase. We
also numerically compute the correlation length critical exponent at the

the Lieb-lattice using an asymptotically exact strong coupling analysis. At
zero temperature and electron density $n = 1$ (one electron per unit cell), for
various ranges of parameters in the model, we exploit a mapping to the quantum
dimer model to establish the existence of a spin-liquid phase with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order (on the triangular lattice) and a
multi-critical line corresponding to a quantum critical spin liquid (on the
square lattice). In the remaining part of the phase diagram, we find a host of
charge-density-wave phases (e.g. valence-bond crystals), a conventional s-wave
superconducting phase, and with the addition of a small Hubbard $U$ to tip the
balance, a phonon-induced d-wave superconducting phase. Under a special
condition, we find a hidden pseudo-spin $SU(2)$ symmetry that implies an exact
constraint on the superconducting order parameters."

condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has
no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically
connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as
superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal
description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase,
utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus
on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected
by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends
on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs
phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has
SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm
analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust
upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined
phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a
boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations.
More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the
emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation
between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase
can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs
condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT
phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge
group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The
sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries,
interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property."

physics despite weak spin-orbit coupling. However, other theoretical and
experimental works found leading XXZ Heisenberg and negligible Kitaev
interactions in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO), which calls for a further study
to clarify the origin of the discrepancies. Here we derive the analytical
expressions of the spin model using strong-coupling perturbation theory. With
tight binding parameters obtained by {\it ab-initio} calculations for idealized
honeycomb BCAO, we find that the largest intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ exchange
path, which was assumed to be small in the earlier theory proposal, leads to a
ferromagnetic (FM) Heisenberg interaction. This becomes the dominant
interaction, as other $t_{2g}-e_g$ and $e_g-e_g$ contributions almost cancel
each other. Exactly the same assumed-to-be-small channel also generates an
antiferromagnetic Kitaev interaction, which then cancels a FM Kitaev
interaction from $t_{2g}-e_g$ paths, resulting in a small Kitaev interaction.
Under the trigonal distortion, the preeminent isotropic Heisenberg becomes an
anisotropic XXZ model as expected, which is the case for BCAO. However, in
Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ the intraorbital $t_{2g}-t_{2g}$ hopping is smaller and
comparable to the $t_{2g}-e_g$ hopping, leading to a delicate competition
between enhanced Kitaev and reduced Heisenberg interactions."

magic angle has received intense attention in recent years. We present a
numerical study of an interacting Bistritzer-MacDonald (IBM) model of TBG using
a suite of methods in quantum chemistry, including Hartree-Fock, coupled
cluster singles, doubles (CCSD), and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), as well as
a quantum chemistry formulation of the density matrix renormalization group
method (DMRG). Our treatment of TBG is agnostic to gauge choices, and hence we
present a new gauge-invariant formulation to detect the spontaneous symmetry
breaking in interacting models. To benchmark our approach, we focus on a
simplified spinless, valleyless IBM model. At integer filling ($\nu=0$), all
numerical methods agree in terms of energy and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking. Additionally, as part of our benchmarking, we explore the impact of
different schemes for removing ``double-counting'' in the IBM model. Our
results at integer filling suggest that cross-validation of different IBM
models may be needed for future studies of the TBG system. After benchmarking
our approach at integer filling, we perform the first systematic study of the
IBM model near integer filling (for $|\nu|< 0.2$). In this regime, we find that
the ground state can be in a metallic and $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry
breaking phase. The ground state appears to have low entropy, and therefore can
be relatively well approximated by a single Slater determinant. Furthermore, we
observe many low entropy states with energies very close to the ground state
energy in the near integer filling regime."

convergence to a user-specified error tolerance $\varepsilon$, emphasizing an
efficient computational scaling with respect to $\eta$. After analyzing the
standard equispaced integration method, applicable in the case of large
broadening, we describe a simple iterated adaptive integration algorithm
effective in the small $\eta$ regime. Its computational cost scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\log^3(\eta^{-1}))$ as $\eta \to 0^+$ in three dimensions, as
opposed to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^{-3})$ for equispaced integration. We argue that,
by contrast, tree-based adaptive integration methods scale only as
$\mathcal{O}(\log(\eta^{-1})/\eta^{2})$ for typical Brillouin zone integrals.
In addition to its favorable scaling, the iterated adaptive algorithm is
straightforward to implement, particularly for integration on the irreducible
Brillouin zone, for which it avoids the tetrahedral meshes required for
tree-based schemes. We illustrate the algorithms by calculating the spectral
function of SrVO$_3$ with broadening on the meV scale."

scale has allowed to perform highly controllable and fine-tuned experiments in
the quantum regime where exotic effects can nowadays be measured. In quantum
dot devices, enhanced conductance below a characteristic energy scale is the
signature of Kondo singlet formation. Precise predictions of quantum transport
properties in similar nanoelectronics devices are desired to design optimal
functionality and control. Standard transport methods suffer from limitations
in nanostructure specifics, set-up design, temperature and voltage regime of
applicability. To overcome these issues, such that we obtain modelling
flexibility and accurate conductance predictions, in this thesis we
analytically derive alternative and improved quantum transport formulations
having as their starting point scattering theory in the Landauer-B\""uttiker
formula, linear response theory in the Kubo formula, nonequilibrium Keldysh
theory in the Meir-Wingreen formula and Fermi liquid theory in the Oguri
formula. We perform a systematic benchmark of our exact expressions, comparing
with the standard approaches using numerical renormalization group techniques.
The new formulations not only reproduce literature results, but also show
higher accuracy and computational efficiency, as well as a wider applicability
under regimes and conditions out of reach by existing methods. We also derive
generalized effective models for multi-orbital two-lead interacting
nanostructures in both Coulomb blockade and mixed-valence regime, which yield
reusable conductance predictions directly in terms of the effective model
parameters. We conclude by applying our novel formulations to complex
nanoelectronics systems, including a single-molecule benzene transistor, a
charge-Kondo quantum dot made from graphene and semiconductor triple quantum
dot."

anisotropy of the quantum critical continuum, which is a feature of these
models, may lead to washing out the quasiparticle peak in one direction while
leaving it intact in the perpendicular one. The effect relies on the
qualitatively different scaling of the self-energy in different directions.
Using the explicit example of the anisotropic Q-lattice model, we demonstrate

Quantum Monte Carlo simulation to the case of link fields. The introduced
Hubbard link fields play a role of the interaction fields responsible for the
attraction and repulsion of electronic excitations at the nodes. Such
improvements leads to a number of advantages concerning thermalization length,
autocorrelations, metastable states and probability distributions of the
quantities. It is demonstrated that computations using five fields are more
stable and reliable in case of energy observables."

in 1D Luttinger liquids and 2D free and interacting Fermi and non-Fermi liquids
emerging at quantum critical points(QCP). Here we study, by means of
large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, the scaling behavior of disorder
operator in correlated Dirac systems. We first demonstrate the logarithmic
scaling behavior of the disorder operator at the Gross-Neveu (GN) chiral Ising
and Heisenberg QCPs, where consistent conformal field theory (CFT) content of
the GN-QCP in its coefficient is found. Then we study a 2D monopole free
deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) realized between a quantum-spin Hall
insulator and a superconductor. Our data point to negative values of the
logarithmic coefficients such that the DQCP does not correspond to a unitary
CFT. Density matrix renormalization group calculations of the disorder operator
on a 1D DQCP model also detect emergent continuous symmetries."
