quantitative study of the basic question how close to invariant can one find
measures on a $G$-space, particularly for the action of the group on itself. As
applications we show:
  (1) On amenable groups there are always ""almost invariant measures"" with
respect to the information theoretic Kullback-Leibler divergence (and more
generally, any $f$-divergence).
  (2) For a free group $F$ and a symmetric measure $\lambda$ supported on its
generators, one can compute explicitly the infimum over all measures $\eta$ on
$F$ of the Furstenberg entropy $h_{\lambda}(F,\eta)$.
  Somewhat surprisingly, while in the case of the uniform measure on the

Poisson boundary of the same measure $\lambda$, in general it is the
Furstenberg entropy of the Poisson boundary of a measure on $F$ different from

and the testability of $E$ depends only on $\Gamma$ (just like in Galois
theory, where the solvability of a polynomial is determined by the solvability

characteristic polynomial of a matrix. We deduce that $\omega$-presented groups
are either perfect or admit the $p$-adic integers as quotients for cofinitely
many primes. We also find necessary conditions for absolute and relative
freeness of $\omega$-presented groups. Our main motivation comes from semigroup
theory: the maximal subgroups of free profinite monoids corresponding to

Aivazidis'), arxiv.Result.Author('M. Loukaki'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. W. Mueller')]","Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We compute the
probability, denoted by $P_G(H)$, that a left transversal of $H$ in $G$ is also
a right transversal, thus a two-sided one. Moreover, we define, and denote by
$\mathrm{tp}(G)$, the common transversal probability of $G$ to be the minimum,
taken over all subgroups $H$ of $G$, of $P_G(H)$. We prove a number of results
regarding the invariant $\mathrm{tp}(G)$, like lower and upper bounds, and
possible values it can attain. We also show that $\mathrm{tp}(G)$ determines
structural properties of $G$. Finally, several open problems are formulated and
discussed."

We conclude this paper by summarising what we achieved and pointing out
some possible directions for further research.","The graph Γ′ as constructed above has 2n + 9 vertices since Λ has n vertices
and we add n + 9 vertices.","In the paper [DW18], Day and
Wade gave a condition for when PSO(AΓ) is a right-angled Artin group and
which one it is.",2022-09-05 16:10:19+00:00,Right-angled Artin groups as finite-index subgroups of their outer automorphism groups,math.GR,"['math.GR', '20E36, 20F36']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Manuel Wiedmer')],"We prove that every right-angled Artin group occurs as a finite-index

we give explicit constructions using the group of pure symmetric outer

this question in Theorem 3.1 by showing that every right-angled Artin group

12540,"Further Questions

We propose the following questions for further research:
    (1) In Section 3 we deﬁned inertness of a set of vertices and showed that it
          implies inertness of the graph.",5.,"We believe that a more general property can
          be deﬁned for arcs, and doing so will allow us to generate an even larger

generalization of echelon subgroups."
13937,"Thus, a natural direction
of further research is to ﬁnd more examples/non-examples of ﬂexible HS-stability in the
hyperbolic realm.","It also does not seem to be known whether
there exists a hyperbolic group that is not ﬂexibly HS-stable.","For more information on Gromov random groups, see [38].",2022-11-18 20:00:07+00:00,Flexible Hilbert-Schmidt stability versus hyperlinearity for property (T) groups,math.GR,"['math.GR', 'math.OA']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Alon Dogon')],"We prove a statement concerning hyperlinearity for central extensions of
property (T) groups in the presence of flexible HS-stability, and more
generally, weak ucp-stability. Notably, this result is applied to show that if
$\text{Sp}_{2g} (\mathbb Z)$ is flexibly HS-stable, then there exists a
non-hyperlinear group. The same phenomenon is shown to hold generically for
random groups sampled in Gromov's density model. These statements give
Hilbert-Schmidt analogues for Bowen and Burton's work relating flexible
P-stability of $\text{PSL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and the existence of non-sofic groups.
Our approach is based on the work of Ioana, Spaas and Wiersma on the lifting
property for $C^*$-algebras."
14287,"For further study One can now, of course, look into pseudo T -solvable groups for yet other
nonsolvable groups T , such as the Suzuki groups.","It turns out that for all of these only the case similar to the
case that there is a t2, 3, 5u triangle for A5 can occur, whereas the second case for A5, that
there is a triangle t3, 5, pu for some odd prime p and which allows for an arbitrary number
of such triangles, is unique to A5.","It might also be interesting to consider
other graph theory aspects of prime graphs of pseudo-solvable groups, such as connectivity

Gruenberg-Kegel graph) has as its vertices the prime divisors of $|G|$, and
$p\text-q$ is an edge in $\Gamma(G)$ if and only if $G$ has an element of order
$pq$. Since their inception in the 1970s these graphs have been studied
extensively; however, completely classifying the possible prime graphs for
larger families of groups remains a difficult problem. For solvable groups such
a classification was found in 2015. In this paper we go beyond solvable groups
for the first time and characterize prime graphs of a more general class of
groups we call pseudo-solvable. These are groups whose composition factors are
either cyclic or $A_5$. The classification is based on two conditions: the
vertices $\{2,3,5\}$ form a triangle in $\overline\Gamma(G)$ or $\{p,3,5\}$
form a triangle for some prime $p\neq 2$."

natural action of $G$ on its Bowditch boundary $\partial (G,\mathcal{P})$ also
induces a hyperfinite equivalence relation. This strengthens a result of Ozawa
obtained for $\mathcal{P}$ consisting of amenable subgroups and uses a recent
work of Marquis and Sabok."

Gruenberg-Kegel graphs. The vertices of the prime graph of a finite group are
the prime divisors of the group order, and two vertices $p$ and $q$ are
connected by an edge if and only if there is an element of order $pq$ in the
group. Prime graphs of solvable groups have been characterized in graph
theoretical terms only, as have been the prime graphs of groups whose only
nonsolvable composition factor is $A_5$. In this paper we classify the prime
graphs of all groups whose composition factors have arithmetically small
orders, that is, have no more than three prime divisors in their orders. We
find that all such graphs have $3$-colorable complements, and we provide full
characterizations of the prime graphs of such groups based on the exact type
and multiplicity of the nonabelian composition factors of the group."
14699,"This motivated extensive
further study of this area, with initial results including positive solutions to
the word problem in certain important cases [6, 14, 16], but the ﬁrst author
[4] eventually showing that, surprisingly, the word problem for special one-

structure than general monoids, this opened up the possibility that the kind
of methods employed in geometric group theory could be used to under-
stand the word problem for one-relator special inverse monoids, and hence
the original one-relator word problem for monoids.","However, the case shown
undecidable is not one arising from the reduction of the one-relator word
problem for monoids, so the latter remains open and a better understanding
of special inverse monoids may yet produce a solution.",2022-12-08 11:40:04+00:00,Group $\mathcal{H}$-classes of finitely presented special inverse monoids,math.GR,"['math.GR', '20F05, 20M18, 20M05']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Robert D.

We show that the group $\mathcal{H}$-classes which can arise in such monoids
are exactly the recursively presented groups, and moreover every such group
$\mathcal{H}$-class can also arise in the $E$-unitary case. We also prove that
the possible groups of units are exactly the finitely generated recursively
presented groups; this improves upon a result of, and answers a question of,
the first author and Ru\v{s}kuc. These results give the first significant
insight into the group $\mathcal{H}$-classes of such monoids beyond the group
of units, and the results together demonstrate that it is possible for the
subgroup structure to have a complexity which significantly exceeds that of the
group of units. We also observe that a finitely presented special inverse
monoid (even an $E$-unitary one) may have infinitely many pairwise
non-isomorphic group $\mathcal{H}$-classes."
