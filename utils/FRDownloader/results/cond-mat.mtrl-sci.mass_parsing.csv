BiCoxFe1 xO3 solid solutions, with 0 < x < 0.13, using density functional
theory. We show that the band gap can be reduced from 2.9 eV to 2.1 eV by
cobalt substitution, while simultaneously increasing the spontaneous
polarisation, which is associated with a notably larger Born effective charge
of Co compared to Fe cations. We discuss the interaction between Co impurities,
which is strongly attractive and would drive the aggregation of Co, as
evidenced by Monte Carlo simulations. Phase separation into a Co-rich phase is
therefore predicted to be thermodynamically preferred, and the homogeneous
solid solution can only exist in metastable form, protected by slow cation
diffusion kinetics. Finally, we discuss the band alignment of pure and
Co-substituted BiFeO3 with relevant redox potentials, in the context of its
applicability in photocatalysis."

for understanding the role of edges and the properties that dictate their

also present in the material. Structural instabilities that arise from the edge
stress could drive the relaxation process and dominate the morphological
response of edges in practice. A clear downward shift of the bands at the
narrower ribbons, as indicative of the edge effect, facilitates the separation
of photo-excited carriers (electrons move towards the edge and holes move
towards the interior part of the nanosheet). Moreover, the desorption energy of
the organic molecule can also be much lower at the free edges, making it easier
for functionalization and/or substitution events to take place. The findings
reported in this work elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for edge

EuIn$_2$As$_2$ has recently been theoretically recognized as a long awaited
intrinsic antiferromagnetic bulk axion insulator. However, the experimental
study on transport properties arising from the topological states in this
material is scarce. In this paper, we perform the detailed magnetoresistance
(MR) and Hall measurements to study the magnetotransport properties of this

configuration of the Eu moments from the concomitant change in the field
dependence of the MR and that of the magnetization below the N\'eel
temperature. Most importantly, an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and a large
topological Hall effect (THE) are observed. We suggest that the AHE is
originated from a nonvanishing net Berry curvature due to the helical spin
structure and that the THE is attributed to the formation of a noncoplanar spin
texture with a finite scalar spin chirality induced by the external magnetic
field in EuIn$_2$As$_2$. Our studies provide a platform to understand the
influence of the interplay between the topology of electronic bands and the
field-induced magnetic structure on magnetoelectric transport properties. In
addition, our observations give a hint to realize axion insulator states and
high-order topological insulator states through manipulating the magnetic state

bipolar power devices based on the 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC). It is well
established that heavy nitrogen (N) doping promotes the conversion of BPDs to
threading edge dislocations (TEDs) and improves the reliability of 4H-SiC-based
bipolar power devices. However, the interaction between N and BPDs, and the
effect of N on the electronic properties of BPDs are still ambiguous, which
significantly hinder the understanding on the electron-transport mechanism of
4H-SiC-based bipolar power devices. Combining molten-alkali etching and the
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis, we demonstrate that BPDs create
acceptor-like states in undoped 4H-SiC, while acting as donors in N-doped
4H-SiC. First-principles calculations verify that BPDs create occupied defect
states above the valence band maximum (VBM) and unoccupied defect states under
the conduction-band minimum (CBM) of undoped 4H-SiC. The electron transfer from
the defect states of intrinsic defects and native impurities to the unoccupied
defect states of BPDs gives rise to the acceptor-like behavior of BPDs in
undoped 4H-SiC. Defect formation energies indicate that N atoms can
spontaneously decorate BPDs during the N doping of 4H-SiC. The binding between
N and BPD is strong against decomposition. The accumulation of N dopants at the
core of BPDs results in the accumulation of donor-like states at the core of
BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC. This work not only enriches the understanding on the
electronic behavior of BPDs in N-doped 4H-SiC, but also helps understand the
electron transport mechanism of 4H-SiC-based bipolar power devices."

hexagonal lattice while the square-planar lattice is uncommon in the family of
two-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that single-atom-thick
transition metal nitride CrN$_4$ monolayer is a stable free-standing layer with
a square-planar network.
  The stability of square-planar geometry is ascribed to the combination of N=N
double bond, Cr-N coordination bond, and $\pi$-d conjugation, in which the
double $\pi$-d conjugation is rarely reported in previous studies.
  This mechanism is entirely different from that of the reported
two-dimensional materials, leading to lower formation energy and more robust
stability compared to the synthesized g-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer.
  On the other hand, CrN$_4$ layer has a ferromagnetic ground state, in which
the ferromagnetic coupling between two Cr atoms is mediated by electrons of the
half-filled large $\pi$ orbitals from $\pi$-d conjugation.
  The high-temperature ferromagnetism in CrN$_4$ monolayer is confirmed by
solving the Heisenberg model with Monte Carlo method."

organic ammonium salts, AX, as a surface passivator, where A is a large organic
cation and X is a halide. These surface treatments passivate the perovskite by
forming layered perovskites (e.g., A2PbX4) or by AX itself serving as a surface
passivation agent on the perovskite photoactive film. It remains unclear
whether layered perovskites or AX is the ideal passivator due to an incomplete
understanding of the interfacial impact and resulting photoexcited carrier
dynamics of AX treatment. In the present study, we use TRPL measurements to
selectively probe the different interfaces of glass/perovskite/AX to
demonstrate the vastly distinct interfacial photoexcited state dynamics with
the presence of A2PbX4 or AX. Coupling the TRPL results with X-ray diffraction
and nanoscale microscopy measurements, we find that the presence of AX not only
passivates the traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, but also induces
an {\alpha}/{\delta}-FAPbI3 phase mixing that alters the carrier dynamics near
the glass/perovskite interface and enhances the photoluminescence quantum
yield. In contrast, the passivation with A2PbI4 is mostly localized to the
surface and grain boundaries near the top surface where the availability of
PbI2 directly determines the formation of A2PbI4. Such distinct mechanisms
significantly impact the corresponding solar cell performance, and we find AX
passivation that has not been converted to a layered perovskite allows for a
much larger processing window (e.g., larger allowed variance of AX
concentration which is critical for improving the eventual manufacturing yield)
and more reproducible condition to realize device performance improvements,
while A2PbI4 as a passivator yields a much narrower processing window. We
expect these results to enable a more rational route for developing AX for
perovskite."

for next-generation display and information technologies. However, similar to
perovskite solar cells, the poor operational stability remains the main
obstacle toward commercial applications. Here we demonstrate ultra-stable and
efficient PeLEDs with extraordinary operational lifetimes (T50) of 1.0x10^4 h,
2.8x10^4 h, 5.4x10^5 h, and 1.9x10^6 h at initial radiance (or current

quantum efficiencies of up to 22.8%. Key to this breakthrough is the
introduction of a dipolar molecular stabilizer, which serves two critical roles
simultaneously. First, it prevents the detrimental transformation and
decomposition of the alpha-phase FAPbI3 perovskite, by inhibiting the formation
of lead and iodide intermediates. Secondly, hysteresis-free device operation
and microscopic luminescence imaging experiments reveal substantially
suppressed ion migration in the emissive perovskite. The record-long PeLED
lifespans are encouraging, as they now satisfy the stability requirement for
commercial organic LEDs (OLEDs). These results remove the critical concern that
halide perovskite devices may be intrinsically unstable, paving the path toward
industrial applications."

triangular lattice, gives rise to the skyrmion physics and long-sought AF-SkX
in the presence of external magnetic field. More intriguingly, this system
presents two different antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases, and such phenomenon
is distinct from those reported in 3D systems. Furthermore, by contacting with

synchro-Shockley dislocations with different Burgers vectors and core
structures and energies are identified. We demonstrate that nucleation and
propagation of kink pairs is the energetically favorable mechanism for the
motion of the synchro-Shockley dislocation (partial I). Vacancy hopping and
interstitial shuffling are identified as two key mechanisms related to kink
propagation and we investigated how vacancies and antisite defects assist kink
nucleation and propagation, which is crucial for kink mobility. Additionally,
we identified a mechanism of non-sequential atomic shuffling for the motion of
the synchro-Shockley dislocation (partial II). These findings provide insights
into the dependency on temperature and chemical composition of plastic
deformation induced by zonal dislocations in Laves phases and the many related

that, to be an elemental polar metal, atoms should occupy at least two
inequivalent Wyckoff positions in a crystal with a polar space group, where
inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken. According to this rule, we propose
the first class of potential ferroelectric-like elemental polar metals in a
distorted {\alpha}-La-like structure with a polar space group P63mc in which
two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a (0, 0, z) and 2b (1/3, 2/3, z) are
occupied by group-V elements (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth).
Analyses based on first-principles calculations indicate that the dynamically
stable polar phase results from a lone pair driven polar distortion of the
nonploar phase in P63/mmc symmetry where two inequivalent Wyckoff positions 2a
(0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) are occupied. This ferroelectric-like
transition involves a transition from a metallic state to a semimetallic state.
These predicted polar phases are metastable with respect to their corresponding
ground phases. Moreover, ionic bonding characters are found due to the
inequivalence in Wyckoff positions between group-V atoms. Our work opens a
route to single-element parity-breaking phases."

inter-atomic exchange coupling is shown to have an oscillatory nature
accompanied by an exponential decay, in accordance with what theory predicts

indicate that the qualitative features of the magnetic coupling for the four

to be related to a single nesting vector, connecting large electrons and hole
pockets. Most interestingly, this behavior is found to be unaffected by changes
induced on the height of the impurity, which makes the magnetism robust to

can link two metal surfaces even in ultra high vacuum. Despite decades of
research, the chain of events leading to vacuum arc breakdowns is hitherto

melts, evaporating neutral atoms that can contribute to plasma buildup.
  In this work, we investigate by means of molecular dynamics simulations
whether surface diffusion biased by the presence of an electric field gradient
can provide sufficient mass transport of atoms toward the top of the nanotip to
maintain supply of neutrals for feeding plasma. To reach the necessary
timescales and to add electric field in MD, we utilized a novel combination of
collective variable~-driven hyperdynamics acceleration and coupling to a finite
element mesh. In our simulations, we observed biased self-diffusion on Cu
surfaces, that can contribute to the continuous replenishment of
particle-emitting nanotips. This mechanism implies a need to reduce the rate of
surface diffusion in devices that are susceptible to vacuum arcs. Finding
suitable alloys or surface treatments that hinder the observed biased diffusion

promising for next-generation electron emitters due to their capability of
producing high-quality electron beams. However, these materials are not yet
well understood, in part due to the technical challenges in growing pure,
ordered alkali antimonides. For example, in the current literature there is a
lack of complete understanding of the mechanically stable crystal structures of
these materials. As a first step towards understanding this issue, this paper
presents an ab initio study of stability of single-crystal mono- and bi-alkali
antimonides in the $D0_3$ structure, the structure generally assumed in the
literature for these materials. Finding that many of these materials actually
are unstable in the $D0_3$ structure, we formulate a new set of
Goldschmidt-like tolerance factors that accurately predict $D0_3$ stability
using a procedure analogous to machine-learning perceptron-based analysis.
Next, we consider possible stable structures for materials that we predict to
be unstable in the $D0_3$ structure. Taking as examples the mono- and bi-alkali
antimonides Cs$_3$Sb and Cs$_2$KSb, which also are technologically interesting
for photoemission and photoabsorption applications, respectively, we note that
the most unstable phonon displacements are consistent with the cubic structure,
and we therefore perform extensive ab initio searches to identify potential
ground-state structures in a cubic lattice. Our X-ray diffraction experiments
confirm that indeed these two materials are not stable in the $D0_3$ structure
and show scattering that is consistent with our new, proposed stable
structures. Finally, we explore ab initio the implications of the breaking of
the $D0_3$ symmetry on the electronic structure, showing significant impact on
the location of the optical absorption edge."

measuring the electron capture (EC) decay of radionuclides implanted into
cryogenic high-resolution sensors. The sensitivity of these experiments has
already reached the level where systematic effects related to atomic-state
energy changes from the host material are a limiting factor. One example is a
neutrino mass study based on the nuclear EC decay of $^7$Be to $^7$Li inside
cryogenic Ta-based sensors. To understand the material effects at the required
level we have used density functional theory and modeled the electronic
structure of lithium atoms in different atomic environments of the
polycrystalline Ta absorber film. The calculations reveal that the Li 1s
binding energies can vary by more than 2 eV due to insertion at different
lattice sites, at grain boundaries, in disordered Ta, and in the vicinity of
various impurities. However, the total range of Li 1s shifts does not exceed 4
eV, even for extreme amorphous disorder. Further, when investigating the
effects on the Li 2s levels, we find broadening of more than 5 eV due to
hybridization with the Ta band structure. Materials effects are shown to
contribute significantly to peak broadening in Ta-based sensors that are used
to search for physics beyond the standard model in the EC decay of $^7$Be, but
they do not explain the full extent of observed broadening. Understanding these

MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has provided a material platform to realize various emergent
phenomena arising from the interplay of magnetism and band topology. Here by
investigating (Mn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$)Bi$_2$Te$_4$ $(0\leq x \leq 0.82)$ single
crystals via the x-ray, electrical transport, magnetometry and neutron
measurements, chemical analysis, external pressure, and first-principles
calculations, we reveal the magnetic dilution effect on the magnetism and band
topology in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. With increasing $x$, both lattice parameters $a$
and $c$ expand linearly by around 2\%. All samples undergo the paramagnetic to
A-type antiferromagnetic transition with the N$\acute{e}$el temperature
decreasing lineally from 24 K at $x=0$ to 2 K at $x=0.82$. Our neutron data
refinement of the $x=0.37$ sample indicates that the ordered moment is
4.3(1)$\mu_B$/Mn at 4.85 K and the amount of the Mn$_{\rm{Bi}}$ antisites is
negligible within the error bars. Isothermal magnetization data reveal a slight
decrease of the interlayer plane-plane antiferromagnetic exchange interaction
and a monotonic decrease of the magnetic anisotropy, due to diluting magnetic
ions and enlarging the unit cell. For $x=0.37$, the application of external
pressures enhances the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, boosting the
N$\acute{e}$el temperature at a rate of 1.4 K/GPa and the saturation field at a
rate of 1.8 T/GPa. Furthermore, our first-principles calculations reveal that
the band inversion in the two end materials, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and PbBi$_2$Te$_4$,
occurs at the $\Gamma$ and $Z$ point, respectively, while two gapless points
appear at $x = $ 0.44 and $x = $ 0.66, suggesting possible topological phase

addition to the double layer capacitance contribution, the porous
interconnected vertical graphene architecture serves as a mechanical backbone

grail for energy storage technology ever since the inception of the first one
in 1986 by Keiichi Kanehori. Solid-state batteries provide the distinct
advantage of outperforming current technology by having a simpler composition,
being easier and cheaper to manufacture, safer and having a higher theoretical
gravimetric and volumetric energy density. The commercialization of this
technology however, is plagued by its own set of challenges, primarily low
ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of the solid-state electrolyte
separating the anode and cathode, a small electrochemical window and sub-par
mechanical properties. In the last decade considerable progress has been made
in remedying these issues with garnet-type electrolytes, especially
Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), having emerged the leading contender. This has prompted
renewed effects into the field of solid-state ionic's and maximizing the ionic
conductivity of LLZO by modifying its properties, primarily by means of doping
with a varying degree of success. Carving a clear road ahead requires an
in-depth understanding of the origin of the high Li+ ion conductivity, the
primary means of investigating which is by first-principle methods. In this
term paper we try to gain insight into the origin of mechanisms at play that
drive the collective migration of Li+ ions in LLZO using a first-principles
approach, to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for optimizing its
properties for use in next-generation energy storage systems."

great interest in excavating novel quantum phases of matter. Latterly, emergent
interfacial ferroelectricity has been surprisingly found in spatial inversion
symmetry broken systems, such as rhombohedral-stacked bilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, the evolution of moire superlattices
corresponding to polarization switching and hysteresis is still unclear, which
is crucial for giving insight into the interplay between lattice symmetry and
band topology, as well as developing optoelectronic memory devices. Here we
report on the observation of phonon splitting at strain soliton networks in
reconstructed moire superlattices, arising from the twisting and relaxing
induced strong three-fold rotational symmetry (C3) breaking. The interval of
phonon splitting is tunable by a perpendicular displacement field and exhibits
ferroelectric-related hysteresis loops. These phonon evolution features are
attributed to the contribution of moire solitons disentangling and lattice
viscosity during the motion of domain walls. Moreover, we demonstrate a
proof-of-principle moire ferroelectric tunneling junction, whose barrier is
modified by net polarization with a tunneling electroresistance of ~10^4. Our
work not only reveals the lattice dynamics of moire solitons but also presents
a potential pathway for future ferroelectric-based optoelectronic memory
devices."

Bismuth selenide ($Bi_2Se_3$) is one of the most promising topological

natural doping, which makes the transport in the bulk dominant. This effect can
be overcome by shifting the chemical potential into the bandgap, turning the
transport of the surface states to be more pronounced than the bulk
counterpart. In this work, $Bi_2Se_3$ was grown by molecular beam epitaxy and

incorporates the growth effect, and the material and geometrical parameters of
the different layers. Then, a series expansion-truncation approach is adopted
to eliminate the thickness variables in the 3D governing system. An elaborate
calculation scheme is applied to derive the iteration relations of the
coefficient functions in the series expansions. Through some further
manipulations, a 2D vector plate equation system with the associated boundary
conditions is established, which only contains the unknowns in the bottom layer
of the plate. To show the efficiency of the current plate theory, three typical
examples regarding the growth-induced deformations and instabilities of
multi-layered plate samples are studied. Some analytical and numerical
solutions to the plate equation are obtained, which can provide accurate
predictions on the growth behaviors of the plate samples. Furthermore, the
problem of `shape-programming' of multi-layered hyperelastic plates through
differential growth is studied. The explicit formulas of shape-programming for
some typical multi-layered plates are derived, which involve the fundamental
quantities of the 3D target shapes. By using these formulas, the shape
evolutions of the plates during the growing processes can be controlled
accurately. The results obtained in the current work are helpful for the design
of intelligent soft devices with multi-layered plate structures."

layers of covalent ceramics were produced using in-situ reactions that occur
during selective laser processing and layer formation. During SLRS, precursor
materials composed of metal and/or metal oxide powders were fashioned into
powder beds for conversion to non-oxide ceramic layers. Laser-processing was
used to initiate simultaneous chemical conversion and local interparticle
bonding of precursor particles in CH4 or NH3 gases. Several factors related to
the reaction synthesis process (precursor chemistry, gas-solid and gas-liquid
synthesis mechanisms, precursor vapor pressures) were investigated in relation
to resulting microstructures and non-oxide yields. Results indicated that the
volumetric changes which occurred during in-situ conversion of single component
precursors negatively impacted the surface layer microstructure. To circumvent
the internal stresses and cracking that accompanied the conversion of Si or Hf

optimized ratios of the precursor constituents were used to produce near

CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2-FeO-Fe2O3-Na2O-K2O-MnO (CMASTFNKM), based on ~2100 data
points mined from ~140 literature studies. The results show that the RF and ANN
models give accurate predictions of glass density with R2 values, RMSE, and
MAPE of ~0.96-0.98, ~0.02-0.03 g/cm3 and ~0.59-0.79%, respectively, for the 15%
testing set, which are more accurate compared with empirical density models
based on ionic packing ratio (with R2 values, RMSE, and MAPE of ~0.28-0.91,
~0.05-0.15 g/cm3, and ~1.40-4.61%, respectively). Furthermore, glass density is
shown to be a reliable reactivity indicator for a range of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS)
and volcanic glasses due to its strong correlation (R2 values above ~0.90) with
the average metal-oxygen dissociation energy (a structural descriptor) of these
glasses. Analysis of the predicted density-composition relationships from these
models (for selected compositional subspaces) suggests that the ANN model
exhibits a certain level of transferability (i.e., ability to extrapolate to
compositional space not (or less) covered in the database) and captures known
features including the mixed alkaline earth effects for
(CaO-MgO)0.5-(Al2O3-SiO2)0.5 glasses."

oxidation occurs in a twostep process characterized by (i) the initial
formation of small CoO crystallites randomly distributed across the
nanoparticle surface, until their coalescence leads to structural completion of
the oxide shell and passivation of the metallic core; (ii) progressive
conversion of the CoO shell to Co3O4, accompanied by void formation due to the
nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The Co nanoparticles remain highly reactive toward
oxygen during phase (i), demonstrating the absence of a pressure gap whereby a
low reactivity at low pressures is postulated. Our results provide an important

compound Mn3Ga is in tetragonal phase. With Co substitution, depending on Co
concentration (x) Mn$_3$Ga prefers tetragonal (cubic) phase when x \leq 0.5 (x
\geq 0.5). Ferrimagnetism is robust regardless of x in both phases. While
magnetic moments of two Mn do not vary significantly with x, Co magnetic moment
in two phases exhibit different behaviors, leading to distinct features in
total magnetic moment (M_{tot}). When x \leq 0.5, in tetragonal phase, Co
magnetic moment is vanishingly small, resulting in a decrease of M_{tot} with
x. In contrast, when x \geq 0.5, in cubic phase, Co magnetic moment is roughly
1$\mu_B$, which is responsible for an increase of Mtot. Electronic structure is
analyzed with partial density of states for various x. To elucidate the
counterintuitively small Co moment, the magnetic exchange interaction is

problems in the physical sciences, uncertainty quantification is becoming
correspondingly more important for their robust application. Uncertainty aware
machine learning methods have been used in select applications, but largely for
scalar properties. In this work, we showcase an exemplary study in which neural
network ensembles are used to predict the X-ray absorption spectra of small
molecules, as well as their point-wise uncertainty, from local atomic
environments. The performance of the resulting surrogate clearly demonstrates
quantitative correlation between errors relative to ground truth and the
predicted uncertainty estimates. Significantly, the model provides an upper
bound on the expected error. Specifically, an important quality of this
uncertainty-aware model is that it can indicate when the model is predicting on
out-of-sample data. This allows for its integration with large scale sampling
of structures together with active learning or other techniques for structure
refinement. Additionally, our models can be generalized to larger molecules
than those used for training, and also successfully track uncertainty due to
random distortions in test molecules. While we demonstrate this workflow on a
specific example, ensemble learning is completely general. We believe it could
have significant impact on ML-enabled forward modeling of a broad array of
molecular and materials properties."

microscopy (AFM) is widely used to observe grain and boundary structures in
topography and subsequently to study the correlative surface potential and
conductivity of these structures. For now, most AFM measurements have been
performed in imaging mode to study the static behavior, in contrast, AFM
spectroscopy mode allows us to investigate the dynamic behavior of materials,
e.g. conductivity under sweeping voltage. However, a major limitation of AFM
spectroscopy measurements is that it requests manual operation by human
operators, as such only limited data can be obtained, hindering systematic
investigations of these microstructures. In this work, we designed a workflow
combining the conductive AFM measurement with a machine learning (ML) algorithm
to systematically investigate grain boundaries in MHPs. The trained ML model
can extract GBs locations from the topography image, and the workflow drives
the AFM probe to each GB location to perform a current-voltage (IV) curve

explore the effect of the CA spatial discretization level and that of the melt

detailed microscopic features related to transient growth conditions and
solid-liquid interface stability (e.g. the initial planar growth stage prior to
its cellular/dendritic destabilization, or the early elimination of unfavorably
oriented grains due to neighbor grain sidebranching) can only be captured by PF
simulations. The resulting disagreement between PF and CA predictions can only
be addressed partially by a refinement of the CA grid. However, overall grain
distributions averaged over the entire melt pools of several simulations seem
to lead to a notably better agreement between PF and CA, with some variability

We examine two BBLs of different molecular masses from different sources. Both
BBLs show significant film swelling during the initial reduction step. By
combining electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM) gravimetry,
in-operando atomic force microscopy (AFM), and both ex-situ and in-operando

structural picture of the electrochemical charge injection process in BBL in
the absence of any hydrophilic side-chains. Compared with ex-situ measurements,
in-operando GIWAXS shows both more swelling upon electrochemical doping than
has previously been recognized, and less contraction upon dedoping. The data
show that BBL films undergo an irreversible hydration driven by the initial
electrochemical doping cycle with significant water retention and lamellar
expansion that persists across subsequent oxidation/reduction cycles. This
swelling creates a hydrophilic environment that facilitates the subsequent fast
hydrated ion transport in the absence of the hydrophilic side-chains used in
many other polymer systems. Due to its rigid ladder backbone and absence of
hydrophilic side-chains, the primary BBL water uptake does not significantly
degrade the crystalline order, and the original dehydrated, unswelled state can
be recovered after drying. The combination of doping induced hydrophilicity and
robust crystalline order leads to efficient ionic transport and good stability."

vitrification process of deeply supercooled multi-component metallic liquids.
Here we describe a state-of-the-art strategy to address these challenges
simultaneously. In the case of the representative Zr-Cu-Al system, in
combination with a general algorithm for generating the neural-network
potentials (NNP) of multi-component metallic glasses effectively and
accurately, we propose a highly efficient atom-swapping hybrid Monte Carlo
(SHMC) algorithm for accelerating the thermodynamic equilibration of deeply
supercooled liquids. Extensive calculations demonstrate that the newly
developed NNP faithfully reproduces the phase stabilities and structural
characteristics obtained from the ab initio calculations and experiments. In
the combined NNP-SHMC algorithm, the structure equilibration time in the deeply
supercooled temperatures is accelerated by at least five orders of magnitudes,
and the quenched glassy samples exhibit comparable stability to those prepared
in the laboratory. Our results pave the way for the next-generation studies of
the vitrification process and, thereby the composition-dependent glass-forming
ability and physical properties of multi-component metallic glasses."

explored, and the crack propagation of different hole shapes is captured, which
shows that the bearing capacity of a plate with a hole is not only related to
the shape of the hole but also related to the location of the hole concentrated
stress and the number of locations where the hole bears the load. The bearing
capacity of the material can be improved by changing the shape of the hole.
These results reveal the influence of different factors on the failure of
composites and lay a foundation for the effective design of composites."

value; however, a recent study has suggested that GB mobility should be
expressed as a tensor. In this work, by using atomistic simulations, the
concept of GB mobility being applied to the shear direction was re-examined and
it is found that it follows the same physical rule as the conventionally
defined GB mobility based on the normal direction. The interface random walk
method was then used to compute the intrinsic GB mobility tensor at the
zero-driving force limit. In order to compute the off-diagonal elements of the
intrinsic GB mobility tensor, a shear coupling strength S is introduced in this
study, which we believe can better reflect the intrinsic characteristics of a
GB for its coupling trend between the normal and shear motion than the widely
used shear coupling factor. Furthermore, the effect of temperature and external
driving force on the GB mobility tensor, especially on its symmetry, was
systematically investigated. It is shown that the GB mobility in either the
normal or shear direction can show a non-Arrhenius type dependence on the
applied driving force, which is similar to the widely reported non-Arrhenius
(or anti-thermal) dependence of GB mobility on temperature. Accordingly, the
classical GB migration equation was adapted to describe the diverse variation
of GB mobility due to changes in both temperature and driving force."

applied to material pairs, the inclusion of additional materials leads to an increased degree

Astolfo'), arxiv.Result.Author('I. G. Haig'), arxiv.Result.Author('D. Bate'), arxiv.Result.Author('A. Olivo'), arxiv.Result.Author('P. Modregger')]","Most material discrimination in security inspections is based on dual-energy
x-ray imaging, which enables the determination of a material's effective atomic
number (Zeff) as well as electron density and its consequent classification as
organic or inorganic. Recently phase-based ""dark-field"" x-ray imaging
approaches have emerged that are sensitive to complementary features of a
material, namely its unresolved microstructure. It can therefore be speculated
that their inclusion in the security-based imaging could enhance material
discrimination, for example of materials with similar electron densities and Z
eff but different microstructures. In this paper, we present a preliminary
evaluation of the advantages that such a combination could bear. Utilising an
energy-resolved detector for a phase-based dark-field technique provides
dual-energy attenuation and dark-field images simultaneously. In addition,
since we use a method based on attenuating x-ray masks to generate the
dark-field images, a fifth (attenuation) image at a much higher photon energy
is obtained by exploiting the x-rays transmitted through the highly absorbing
mask septa. In a first test, a threat material is imaged against a non-threat
one, and we show how their discrimination based on maximising their relative
contrast through linear combinations of two and five imaging channels leads to
an improvement in the latter case. We then present a second example to show how
the method can be extended to discrimination against more than one non-threat
material, obtaining similar results. Albeit admittedly preliminary, these
results indicate that significant margins of improvement in material
discrimination are available by including additional x-ray contrasts in the
scanning process."
