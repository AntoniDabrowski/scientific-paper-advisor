of reactions $Y\to Y'$, each converting a multiset of educts $Y\subseteq X$
into a multiset $Y'\subseteq X$ of products. RNs are equivalent to directed
hypergraphs. However, not all RNs necessarily admit a chemical interpretation.
Instead, they might contradict fundamental principles of physics such as the
conservation of energy and mass or the reversibility of chemical reactions. The
consequences of these necessary conditions for the stoichiometric matrix
$\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{X\times\mathscr{R}}$ have been discussed
extensively in the literature. Here, we provide sufficient conditions for
$\mathbf{S}$ that guarantee the interpretation of RNs in terms of balanced sum
formulas and structural formulas, respectively.
  Chemically plausible RNs allow neither a perpetuum mobile, i.e., a ""futile
cycle"" of reactions with non-vanishing energy production, nor the creation or
annihilation of mass. Such RNs are said to be thermodynamically sound and
conservative. For finite RNs, both conditions can be expressed equivalently as
properties of $\mathbf{S}$. The first condition is vacuous for reversible
networks, but it excludes irreversible futile cycles and - in a stricter sense
- futile cycles that even contain an irreversible reaction. The second
condition is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive reaction
invariant. Furthermore, it is sufficient for the existence of a realization in
terms of sum formulas, obeying conservation of ""atoms"". In particular, these
realizations can be chosen such that any two species have distinct sum
formulas, unless $\mathbf{S}$ implies that they are ""obligatory isomers"". In
terms of structural formulas, every compound is a labeled multigraph, in
essence a Lewis formula, and reactions comprise only a rearrangement of bonds
such that the total bond order is preserved."

information via signals that vary in time. Computing the information
transmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of
these signals, requires the mutual information between the input and output
signals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories.
Yet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of
the trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We
present an exact Monte Carlo technique called Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that,
for the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between
input and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a
master equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate
the exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a
given input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory
space to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which
all generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation
algorithm. While Direct PWS is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS
exploits the analogy between signal trajectory sampling and polymer sampling,
and Thermodynamic Integration PWS is based on a reversible work calculation in
trajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information
between input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states
as well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the
bacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 173 coupled chemical reactions,
demonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the
appropriate measure for quantifying information transmission via time-varying
signals is indeed the information transmission rate."

from the interplay of genetic predisposition and fluctuating environmental
stimuli. We formalize this situation in a minimal model, where a network
(representing cellular regulation) serves as an interface between an input
layer (representing environment) and an output layer (representing functional
phenotype). Genetic predisposition for a disease is represented as a loss of
function of some network nodes. Reduced, but non-zero, output indicates
disease. The simplicity of this genetic disease model and its deep relationship
to percolation theory allows us to understand the interplay between disease,
network topology and the location and clusters of affected network nodes. We
find that our model generates two different characteristics of diseases, which
can be interpreted as chronic and acute diseases. In its stylized form, our
model provides a new view on the relationship between genetic mutations and the
type and severity of a disease."
