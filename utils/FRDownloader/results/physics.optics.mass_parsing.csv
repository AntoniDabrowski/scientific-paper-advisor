are unable to leak out of the cavity. Bound state in continuum (BIC) cavities
are an unconventional alternative, where light can leak out, but is confined by
multimodal destructive interference. BICs are a general wave phenomenon, of
particular interest to optics, but BICs and multimodal interference have never
been demonstrated at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate the first nanophotonic
cavities based on BIC-like multimodal interference. This novel confinement
mechanism for deep sub-wavelength light shows orders of magnitude improvement
in several confinement metrics. Specifically, we obtain cavity volumes below
100x100x3nm^3 with quality factors about 100, with extreme cases having
23x23x3nm^3 volumes or quality factors above 400. Key to our approach, is the
use of pristine crystalline hyperbolic dispersion media (HyM) which can support
large momentum excitations with relatively low losses. Making a HyM cavity is
complicated by the additional modes that appear in a HyM. Ordinarily, these
serve as additional channels for leakage, reducing cavity performance. But, in
our experiments, we find a BIC-like cavity confinement enhancement effect,
which is intimately related to the ray-like nature of HyM excitations. In fact,
the quality factors of our cavities exceed the maximum that is possible in the
absence of higher order modes. The alliance of HyM with BICs in our work yields
a radically novel way to confine light and is expected to have far reaching
consequences wherever strong optical confinement is utilized, from ultra-strong
light-matter interactions, to mid-IR nonlinear optics and a range of sensing
applications."

as the building block for further constructing the superlattices. By exploiting
the separation between two dimerized interface states and the distinct inter-

theory, we propose a realistic reciprocal two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal
(PhC) system that shows the desired skin effect. Specifically, we establish a
routine for designing such non-Hermitian systems via revealing the inherent
connections between the non-trivial eigenvalue topology of order-2 exceptional
points (EPs) and the skin effects. Guided by the proposed strategy, we
successfully design a 2D PhC that possesses the EPs with nonzero eigenvalue
winding numbers. The spectral area along a specific wavevector direction is
then formed by leveraging the symmetry of the macroscopic geometry and the unit
cell. The projected-band-structure calculations are performed to demonstrate
that the desired skin effect exists at the specific crystalline interfaces. We
finally employ time-domain simulations to vividly illustrate this phenomenon by
exciting a pulse at the center of a finite-sized PhC. Our results form a solid

focused to the TW/cm2 level. In a single pass through a 500 {\mu}m ZnO crystal

a technique of carrier-envelope amplitude modulation spectroscopy (CAMS) and
use it to characterize the phase-sensitive modulation of the ultraviolet

non-perturbative nature of the harmonic generation through polarization gating
of the driving pulse to increase the effects of the carrier-envelope phase. Our

characterizing harmonic generation at 100 MHz rates that should provide

PPM and the PSM, showing that the the cross-spectral density function equals
the trace of the product of the PSM and the transpose of the PPM. Based on
this, the spectral degree of coherence (SDOC) of the scattered field is further
analysed. We show that for a special case where the spatial distributions of
scattering potentials of different types of particles are similar and the same
is true of their density distributions, the PPM and the PSM will reduce to two
new matrices whose elements separately quantify degree of angular correlation
of the scattering potentials of particles and their density distributions, and
the number of species of particles in this special case as a scaled factor
ensures the normalization of the SDOC. Two special hybrid particulate systems
as examples are given to illustrate the importance of our new approach."

manipulation of light with complete control of amplitude and phase at
sub-wavelength scales. One limitation, however, for most of these devices is
the lack of any post-fabrication tunability of their response. To break this
limit, a promising approach is employing phase-change-materials (PCM), which
provide a fast, low energy and non-volatile means to endow metasurfaces with a
switching mechanism. In this regard, great advancements have been done in the
mid infrared and near infrared spectrum using different chalcogenides. In the
visible spectral range, however, very few devices have demonstrated full phase
manipulation, high efficiencies, and reversible switching. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate a tunable all-dielectric Huygens metasurface made of
antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) PCM, a low loss and high-index material in the visible
spectral range with a large contrast (nearly 0.5) between its amorphous and
crystalline states. We show close to 2pi phase modulation with high associated
transmittance and use it to create switchable beam steering and holographic
display devices. These novel chalcogenide PCM metasurfaces have the potential
to emerge as a platform for next generation spatial light modulators and to
impact application areas such as tunable and adaptive flat optics, LiDAR, and
many more."

broken-symmetry blocks is reported. Theoretical analysis reveals that the sharp
resonances in the metasurfaces originate from symmetry-protected bound states
in the continuum (BIC) and the magnetic dipole dominates these peculiar states.
A smaller size of the defect in the broken-symmetry block gives rise to the
resonance with a larger Q factor. Importantly, this relationship can be tuned
by changing the structural parameter, resulting from the modulation of the
topological configuration of BICs. Consequently, a Q factor of more than 3,000
can be easily achieved by optimizing dimensions of the nanostructure. At this
sharp resonance, the intensity of the third harmonic generation signal in the
patterned structure can be 368 times larger than that of the flat silicon film.
The proposed strategy and underlying theory can open up new avenues to realize
ultrasharp resonances, which may promote the development of the potential
meta-devices for nonlinearity, lasing action, and sensing."

difference of the angular momentum of the WGM and that of the grating, provides
a scalable, chip-integrated solution for OAM generation. However, demonstrated
OAM microresonators have exhibited a much lower quality factor ($Q$) than
conventional WGM resonators (by $>100\times$), and an understanding of the
ultimate limits on $Q$ has been lacking. This is crucial given the importance
of $Q$ in enhancing light-matter interactions, such as single emitter coupling

applications. Moreover, though high-OAM states are often desirable, the limits
on what is achievable in a microresonator configuration are not well

photonic crystal ring, and linking it to the commonly studied case of coherent
backscattering between counter-propagating WGMs. In addition to demonstrating
high-$Q$ ($10^5$ to $10^6$), high estimated OAM ejection efficiency (up to

classical Mie theory when the host medium is dispersive and transparent.
However, the role of host dissipation on the particulate extinction remains a
competition between the enhancing and reducing effects on the localized surface
plasmonic resonance (LSPR). Here, using a generalized Mie theory, we elaborate
on the specific influence mechanisms of host dissipation on the extinction
efficiency factors of a plasmonic nanosphere. To this end, we isolate the
dissipative effects by comparing the dispersive and dissipative host with its
transparent counterpart. As a result, we identify the damping effects of host
dissipation on the LSPR including the resonance widening and amplitude
reducing. The resonance positions are shifted by host dissipation, which cannot
be predicted by the classical Fr\""ohlich condition. Finally, we demonstrate
that a wide-band extinction enhancement due to host dissipation can be realized
away from the positions of LSPR."

generate compact, optical-frequency microcombs, which enable an ever growing
number of applications. Microcombs exhibit a spectral profile that is primarily
determined by the group-velocity dispersion of their microresonator; an example
is the $ \operatorname{sech}^2 $ spectrum of the driven, dissipative Kerr
soliton with predominantly anomalous second-order dispersion. Here, we
introduce an inverse design approach to spectrally shape Kerr microcombs, by
generating an arbitrary meta-dispersion in a resonator. We develop a genetic
algorithm to effectively invert the Lugiato-Lefever equation, which models
these systems, in favor of a user-defined target spectrum. The algorithm
determines a near-optimal dispersion profile, yielding a microcomb design with
the target shape. We consider several use cases, such as generating
near-Gaussian pulses, a telecom-optimized microcomb with constant power per
mode, and enhanced dispersive-wave. We show how to implement these complex,
optimized resonator dispersion profiles, using selective, bidirectional-mode
hybridization in photonic-crystal resonators. Moreover, we fabricate and
explore several microcomb generators with such flexible 'meta' dispersion
control. In these systems, the dispersion is not only controlled by the
waveguide composing the resonator, but also by a corrugation pattern within the
resonator, which geometrically controls the spectral distribution of the
bidirectional coupling in the resonator. This approach enables a programmable
mode-by-mode frequency splitting that is the essence of controlling the
nonlinear dynamics of stationary optical states like Kerr solitons."

the plane of the aperture whose value is defined by SPPs with any number of
modes in the waveguide through the equivalence principle. Then, the generated
SPPs on the both sides of the aperture are extracted from the convolution
integral of the equivalent current density and Green's function. As a result,
the model provides the transmission coefficients of SPPs in the MIM to the side

because it provides brand new physical principles to manipulate light. Band
topology of optical materials is characterized using the Berry phase defined by
Bloch states. Until now, the criteria for experimentally probing the
topological phase transition of band topology has always been relatively
lacking in topological physics. Moreover, radiation topology can be aroused by
the far-field polarizations of the radiating Bloch states, which is described
by the Stokes phase. Although such two types of topologies are both related to
Bloch states on the band structure, it is rather surprising that their
development is almost independent. Here, we reveal that the phase transition of
band topology can be probed by the radiation topology. We theoretically design
and experimentally demonstrate such an intriguing phenomenon by constructing
photonic crystals that support optical analogs of quantum spin Hall effects.
The results show that the topological charge of the far-field polarization
vortex changes from +1 to -2 or from -2 to +1 when the band topology changes
from trivial to non-trivial, which provides a new criterion to probe the phase
transition of band topology using radiation topology. Our findings not only
provide an insightful understanding of band topology and radiation topology,

lasers or quantum emitters to other useful colors, but chromatic dispersion
limits the range of achievable wavelength shifts. Moreover, because of
geometric dispersion, fabrication tolerances reduce the accuracy with which
devices produce specific target wavelengths. Here, we report nonlinear
wavelength converters whose operation is not contingent on dispersion
engineering; yet, the output wavelengths are controlled with high accuracy. In
our scheme, coherent coupling between counter-propagating waves in a photonic
crystal microresonator induces a photonic bandgap that isolates (in dispersion
space) specific wavenumbers for nonlinear gain. We first demonstrate the wide
applicability of this strategy to parametric nonlinear processes, by simulating
its use in third harmonic generation, dispersive wave formation in Kerr
microcombs, and four-wave mixing Bragg scattering. In experiments, we
demonstrate Kerr optical parametric oscillators in which such
wavenumber-selective coherent coupling designates the signal mode. As a result,
differences between the targeted and realized signal wavelengths are <0.3
percent. Moreover, leveraging the bandgap-protected wavenumber selectivity, we
continuously tune the output frequencies by nearly 300 GHz without compromising
efficiency. Our results will bring about a paradigm shift in how
microresonators are designed for nonlinear optics, and they make headway on the
larger problem of building wavelength-accurate light sources using integrated
photonics."

photonics have greatly broadened the horizon in designing the metasurfaces for
novel functional applications. In this review, we summarize recent progress in
the research field of topological metasurfaces, firstly from the perspectives
of passive and active in the classical regime, and then in the quantum regime.
More specifically, we begin by examining the passive topological phenomena in
two-dimensional photonic systems, including both time-reversal broken systems
and time-reversal preserved systems. Subsequently, we move to discuss the
cutting-edge studies of the active topological metasurfaces, including
nonlinear topological metasurfaces and reconfigurable topological metasurfaces.
After overviewing the topological metasurfaces in the classical regime, we show
how the topological metasurfaces could provide a new platform for quantum
information and quantum many-body physics. Finally, we conclude and describe
some challenges and future directions of this fast-evolving field."

(SPAD) array has been widely applied in various fields such as fluorescence
lifetime imaging and quantum computing. However, large-scale high-fidelity
single-photon imaging remains a big challenge, due to the complex hardware
manufacture craft and heavy noise disturbance of SPAD arrays. In this work, we
introduce deep learning into SPAD, enabling super-resolution single-photon
imaging over an order of magnitude, with significant enhancement of bit depth
and imaging quality. We first studied the complex photon flow model of SPAD
electronics to accurately characterize multiple physical noise sources, and
collected a real SPAD image dataset (64 $\times$ 32 pixels, 90 scenes, 10
different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2790 images in total) to
calibrate noise model parameters. With this real-world physical noise model, we
for the first time synthesized a large-scale realistic single-photon image
dataset (image pairs of 5 different resolutions with maximum megapixels, 17250
scenes, 10 different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2.6 million
images in total) for subsequent network training. To tackle the severe
super-resolution challenge of SPAD inputs with low bit depth, low resolution,
and heavy noise, we further built a deep transformer network with a
content-adaptive self-attention mechanism and gated fusion modules, which can
dig global contextual features to remove multi-source noise and extract
full-frequency details. We applied the technique on a series of experiments
including macroscopic and microscopic imaging, microfluidic inspection, and
Fourier ptychography. The experiments validate the technique's state-of-the-art
super-resolution SPAD imaging performance, with more than 5 dB superiority on
PSNR compared to the existing methods."
