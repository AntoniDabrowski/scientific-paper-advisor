death worldwide and the second highest cause of mortality in the United States.
Researching the optimal control treatment or intervention strategy on the
comprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this purpose,
first, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our
previous work. Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis
subsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The
bifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control
treatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any
control under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will
perform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop
our complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control
model, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic
practices as optimization objective function to measure the development of
sepsis. Besides that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent
neural network (RNN-BO algorithm) is introduced to predict the optimal control
strategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system. The difference between
the RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given any
new initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial
conditions of patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting
a corresponding time-series optimal control based on the historical optimal
control data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution on
the complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented
by comparing with other optimization algorithms in this paper."

  The goal of this paper is to study the invariant sets generated by resonances
under foliation preserving torus maps. That is torus which preserve a foliation
of irrational lines $L_{\theta_{0}}=\{\theta_{0}+\Omega t |
t\in\mathbb{R}\}\subset\mathbb{T}^{d}$.
  Foliation preserving maps appear naturally as reparametrization of linear
flows in the torus and also play an important role in several applications
involving coupled oscillators, delay equations, resonators with moving walls,
etc. The invariant objects we find here, lead to predictions on the behavior of
these models.
  Since the results of this paper are meant to be applied for other problems,
we have developed very quantitative results giving very explicit descriptions
of the phenomena and the invariant objects that control them.
  The structure of the phase locking regions for foliation preserving maps is
very different than for generic maps of the torus. Indeed, for the sake of
completeness, we have developed similar analysis for the case of generic maps

found experimentally and numerically in various continuum models. However,
there is currently no mathematical theory for the emergence of these localised
cellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that standard
techniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for
understanding localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a
comprehensive approach to this problem by using techniques developed in the
study of radially-symmetric patterns. Our analysis covers localised planar
patterns equipped with a wide range of dihedral symmetries, thereby avoiding a
restriction to solutions on a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper
is a theory for the emergence of such patterns near a Turing instability for a
general class of planar reaction-diffusion equations. Posing the
reaction-diffusion system in polar coordinates, we carry out a finite-mode
Fourier decomposition in the angular variable to yield a large system of
coupled radial ordinary differential equations. We then perform radial
invariant-manifold and normal form analysis, leading to an algebraic matching
condition for localised patterns to exist in the finite-mode reduction. This
algebraic matching condition is nontrivial, and solving it reveals the
existence of a plethora of localised dihedral patterns. These results capture
the essence of the emergent localised hexagonal patterns witnessed in
experiments. Moreover, we combine rigorous numerics and a Newton-Kantorovich
procedure to prove the existence of localised patches with 6m-fold symmetry for
arbitrarily large Fourier decompositions. This includes the localised hexagon

revealed by linearizing the governing differential equations about the
collinear Lagrange points. This procedure fails when time-periodic
perturbations are considered, such as perturbation due to the sun (i.e., the
bicircular problem) or orbital eccentricity of the primaries. For the case of a
time-periodic perturbation, the Lagrange point is replaced by a periodic orbit,
equivalently viewed as a hyperbolic-elliptic fixed point of a symplectic map
(the stroboscopic Poincar\'e map). Transit and non-transit orbits can be
identified in the discrete map about the fixed point, in analogy with the
geometric construction of Conley and McGehee about the index-1 saddle
equilibrium point in the continuous dynamical system. Furthermore, though the
continuous time system does not conserve the Hamiltonian energy (which is
time-varying), the linearized map locally conserves a time-independent
effective Hamiltonian function. We demonstrate that the phase space geometry of
transit and non-transit orbits is preserved in going from the unperturbed to a
periodically-perturbed situation, which carries over to the full nonlinear
equations."

to systematically approximate, in principle exactly, the macroscale closure of

approach, developed through rigorous theory and verified with computer algebra,
systematically constructs discrete macroscale models through physics informed
by the PDE out-of-equilibrium dynamics, thus relaxing many assumptions
regarding the subgrid structure. The construction is analogous to recent
gray-box machine learning techniques in that predictions are directed by
iterative layers (as in neural networks), but informed by the subgrid physics
(or 'data') as expressed in the PDEs. A major development of the holistic
methodology, presented herein, is novel inter-element coupling between subgrid
fields which preserve self-adjointness of the PDE after macroscale
discretisation, thereby maintaining the spectral structure of the original

contact point $p$, for $\lambda=\lambda_0$, in smooth planar slow$-$fast
systems $X_{\epsilon,\lambda}$ when the contact order $n_{\lambda_0}(p)$ of $p$
is even, the singularity order $s_{\lambda_0}(p)$ of $p$ is odd and $p$ has
finite slow divergence, i.e., $s_{\lambda_0}(p)\leq 2(n_{\lambda_0}(p)-1)$. The
fractal codimension of $p$ is a generalization of the traditional codimension
of a slow-fast Hopf point of Li\'{e}nard type, introduced in (Dumortier and
Roussarie (2009)), and it is intrinsically defined, i.e., it can be directly
computed without the need to first bring the system into its normal form. The
intrinsic nature of the notion of fractal codimension stems from the Minkowski
dimension of fractal sequences of points, defined near $p$ using the
so$-$called entry$-$exit relation, and slow divergence integral. We apply our
method to a slow$-$fast Hopf point and read its degeneracy (i.e., the first
nonzero Lyapunov quantity) as well as the number of limit cycles near such a
Hopf point directly from its fractal codimension. We demonstrate our results
numerically on some interesting examples by using a simple formula for
computation of the fractal codimension. We demonstrate our results numerically

consequences on the numerical precision. Moreover, we apply principal geodesic
analysis to investigate the behavior of several mechanical systems that are
very rich in dynamics. The examples chosen are computationally modeled by
employing a director-based formulation for rigid and flexible mechanical
systems. Such a formulation allows to investigate our algortihms in a direct

a careful selection of perturbations to establish a reliable sampling of the

vectors of the tangent linear model propagator are used to identify the fastest
growing modes (classical singular vector perturbation (SV) method). In this
paper we present an efficient matrix-free block Krylov method for generating
fast growing perturbations in high dimensional dynamical systems. A specific
matrix containing the non-linear evolution of perturbations is introduced,
which we call Evolved Increment Matrix (EIM). Instead of solving an equivalent
eigenvalue problem, we use the Arnoldi method for a direct approximation of the
leading singular vectors of this matrix, which however is never computed
explicitly. This avoids linear and adjoint models but requires forecasts with
the full non-linear system. The performance of the approximated perturbations
is compared with singular vectors of a full EIM (not with the classical SV

a shallow water model, where we obtain good approximations of the fastest
growing perturbations by using only a small number of Arnoldi iterations."

of the principle is that smooth nonlinear systems can be written as quadratic
systems in an appropriate lifted coordinate system without any approximation
error. Hand-designing these coordinates is not straightforward. In this work,
we utilize deep learning capabilities and discuss suitable neural network
architectures to find such a coordinate system using data. We present
innovative neural architectures and the corresponding objective criterion to
achieve our goal. We illustrate the approach using data coming from
applications in engineering and biology."

we analyse the celebrated Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model, describing the dynamics

dynamics, stability, nonlinear behaviour and bifurcations of this model by both
theoretical and numerical analysis. We calculate in-phase and anti-phase limit
cycles as well as quasi-periodic solutions via double Hopf bifurcation analysis
and centre manifold reduction. Moreover, we uncover further details on the
global dynamic behaviour by numerical continuation, including the occurrence of
limit cycles in phase quadrature and 1-1 locking of quasi-periodic solutions."

consist of colorings of the grid Z2 where adjacent colours must be neighbors in
a fixed finite undirected simple graph G. This class includes several important
statistical physics models such as the hard square model. The gluing gap
measures how far any two square patterns of size n can be glued, which can be
seen as a measure of the range of order, and affects the possibility to compute
the entropy (or free energy per site) of a shift. This motivates a study of the
possible behaviors of the gluing gap. The class of Hom shifts has the interest
that mixing type properties can be formulated in terms of algebraic graph
theory, which has received a lot of attention recently. Improving some former
work of N. Chandgotia and B. Marcus, we prove that the gluing gap either
depends linearly on n or is dominated by log(n). We also find a Hom shift with
gap {\Theta}(log(n)), infirming a conjecture formulated by R. Pavlov and M.
Schraudner. The physical interest of these results is to better understand the
transition from short-range to long-range order (respectively sublogarithmic
and linear gluing gap), which is reflected in whether some parameter, the
square cover, is finite or infinite."

it admits a continuous action on the Cantor space with a comeager conjugacy
class. We show that having the STRP is a symbolic dynamical property. We prove
that a countable group $G$ has the STRP if and only if certain sofic subshifts
over $G$ are dense in the space of subshifts. A sufficient condition is that
isolated shifts over $G$ are dense in the space of all subshifts.
  We provide numerous applications including the proof that a group that
decomposes as a free product of finite or cyclic groups has the STRP. We show
that finitely generated nilpotent groups do not have the STRP unless they are
virtually cyclic as well as many groups of the form $G_1\times G_2\times G_3$
where each factor is recursively presented. We show that a large class of
non-finitely generated groups do not have the STRP, this includes any group
with infinitely generated center and the Hall universal locally finite group.
  We find a strong connection between the STRP and shadowing, a.k.a.
pseudo-orbit tracing property. In particular, we show that shadowing is generic
for actions of free products of finite and cyclic groups, and that shadowing is
not generic for groups without the STRP.
  We also consider the STRP for totally disconnected locally compact groups and
characterize pro-countable metrizable groups with the STRP. In particular,
inverse limits of groups with the STRP have the STRP and so every pro-finite
group has the STRP."

flows on closed 3-manifolds, up to orbit equivalence.
  In many cases, flows on a 3-manifold $M$ are completely determined by the set
of free homotopy classes of their (unoriented) periodic orbits. The exceptional
cases are flows with a special structure in their orbit space called a ``tree
of scalloped regions""; in these cases the set of free homotopy classes of
unoriented periodic orbits together with the additional data of a choice of
sign for each $\pi_1(M)$-orbit of tree gives a complete invariant of orbit
equivalence classes of flows.
  The framework for the proof is a more general result about \emph{Anosov-like
actions} of abstract groups on bifoliated planes, showing that the
homeomorphism type of the bifoliation and the conjugacy class of the action can
be recovered from knowledge of which elements of the group act with fixed
points.
  As a consequence, we show that Anosov flows are determined up to orbit
equivalence by the action on the ideal boundary of their orbit spaces, and more
generally that transitive Anosov-like actions on bifoliated planes are
determined up to conjugacy by their actions on the plane's ideal boundary: any
conjugacy between two such actions on their ideal circles can be extended
uniquely to a conjugacy on the interior of the plane."
