5 Conclusion and future work

    This paper presents some initial results towards a deep connection between dynamics and dif-
ferential algebra with the focus on stability problems in symbolic integration.","To conclude this paper, we propose some problems for future work.",2022-02-13 13:00:31+00:00,Stability Problems in Symbolic Integration,cs.SC,"['cs.SC', 'math.AC', 'math.DS', '12H05, 37P15, 33F10,', 'I.1.2']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Shaoshi Chen')],"This paper aims to initialize a dynamical aspect of symbolic integration by
studying stability problems in differential fields. We present some basic
properties of stable elementary functions and D-finite power series that enable
us to characterize three special families of stable elementary functions
involving rational functions, logarithmic functions, and exponential functions.
Some problems for future studies are proposed towards deeper dynamical studies
in differential and difference algebra."

between the Gr\""obner bases based on the Buchberger's algorithm and the
characteristic sets based on the Wu's method. It reduces the complexity of the
traditional Gr\""obner bases and subdues the notorious intermediate expression
swell problem and intermediate coefficient swell problem to a substantial
extent. The computation of an $S$-polynomial for the new bases requires at most
$O(m\ln^2m\ln\ln m)$ word operations whereas $O(m^6\ln^2m)$ word operations are
requisite in the Buchberger's algorithm. Here $m$ denotes the upper bound for
the numbers of terms both in the leading coefficients and for the rest of the
polynomials. The new bases are for zero-dimensional polynomial ideals and based
on univariate pseudo-divisions. However in contrast to the pseudo-divisions in
the Wu's method for the characteristic sets, the new bases retain the algebraic
information of the original ideal and in particular, solve the ideal membership
problem. In order to determine the authentic factors of the eliminant, we
analyze the multipliers of the pseudo-divisions and develop an algorithm over
principal quotient rings with zero divisors."

Brown'), arxiv.Result.Author('James H. Davenport'), arxiv.Result.Author('Matthew England')]","Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers check the satisfiability of
quantifier-free first-order logic formulas. We consider the theory of
non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of
polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the Cylindrical Algebraic
Decomposition (CAD) to decompose real space into cells where the constraints
are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.
  An improved approach is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based
algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and
generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around
samples which are avoided in the continuing search. Such an approach can lead
to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with
fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanovi\'c and de Moura's
NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are produced locally to a sample we might
need fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The
original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell
construction reduced it much further still. However, the shape and size of the
cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.
  This paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built
level-by-level according to a variable ordering. We still use a reduced number
of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different
reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to
optimise the shape of the cell under construction. We formulate all the
necessary theory as a proof system: while not a common presentation for work in
this field, it allows an elegant decoupling of heuristics from the algorithm
and its proof of correctness."
