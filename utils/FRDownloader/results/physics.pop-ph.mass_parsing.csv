ready to exploit. SGL physics started with Einstein's 1936 paper on the
gravitational lensing; it was not until 1979 that the idea of a space mission
reaching the Sun's nearest focal sphere at 550 Astronomical Units (AU) was put
forward by Von Eshleman. By the year 2000, the senior author of this paper (CM)
had submitted a relevant formal proposal to ESA about the relevant space
mission to 550 AU. He presented his ideas at NASA-JPL for the first time on
August 18. In 2020 NASA awarded a $2million grant to JPL to prepare for the
first FOCAL space mission. But radio bridges between the Sun and any nearby
star may also be conceived. The idea is that, if Humanity will be able to send
unmanned space probes to the nearest stars in the future, each of these probes
could be placed behind the star of arrival and along the star-Sun line, thus
allowing for TWO gravitational lenses to work together. That will result in a
permanent communication system with much REDUCED POWERS to keep the radio link
between the two stellar systems: a veritable Galactic Internet. In this paper,
we study for the first time the 50 radio bridges between the Sun and each of
the nearest 100 stars in the Galaxy. Of course, this work is for the centuries
to come. But knowing which natural radio bridge between the Sun and each of the
nearest 50 stars is MORE CONVENIENT, will open the ROAD MAP for the HUMAN
EXPANSION into the Galaxy."

one ﬁnds very good agreement between theory and observations.","Primordial deuterium leaves an imprint in the spectra
of high-redshift quasar absorption systems; primordial helium-4 is found in low-metallicity regions of ionized
hydrogen; and primordial lithium-7 shows up in the spectra of old metal-poor dwarf stars in the halo of our

of the fact that the measured abundances range over nine orders of magnitude.",2022-02-27 01:23:02+00:00,"Modern Cosmology, an Amuse-Gueule",physics.pop-ph,"['physics.pop-ph', 'astro-ph.CO', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Kai Schmitz')],"This essay is a nontechnical primer for a broader audience, in which I paint
a broad-brush picture of modern cosmology. I begin by reviewing the evidence
for the big bang, including the expansion of our Universe, the cosmic microwave
background, and the primordial abundances of the light elements. Next, I
discuss how these and other cosmological observations can be well explained by
means of the concordance model of cosmology, putting a particular emphasis on
the composition of the cosmic energy budget in terms of visible matter, dark
matter, and dark energy. This sets the stage for a short overview of the
history of the Universe from the earliest moments of its existence all the way
to the accelerated expansion at late times and beyond. Finally, I summarize the
current status of the field, including the challenges it is currently facing
such as the Hubble tension, and conclude with an outlook onto the bright future
that awaits us in the coming years and decades. The text is complemented by an
extensive bibliography serving as a guide for readers who wish to delve deeper."

A systematic ordering of foods in the Soup-Salad-Sandwich phase space,physics.pop-ph,"['physics.pop-ph', 'cond-mat.soft']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Madelyn Leembruggen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Caroline Martin')]","The statistical physics of phase transitions has been hugely successful at
describing numerous natural, physical, and technological phenomena, and now a
rigorous examination of the phase space of the culinary regime is likewise ripe
for the picking. Despite great demand for the resolution of many scientific
debates over the taxonomy of food, past attempts have failed to account for
complex phase behavior and co-existence, and have thus left the public hungry
for a more substantial theory. By applying the principles of statistical
physics and thermodynamics, we here map out the complete phase space of all
culinary dishes and find three distinct phase regimes: Soup, Salad, and
Sandwich. We consider the effect of different state variables on these phase
boundaries, as well as regions of co-existence and triple points. With this
complete 3-dimensional phase diagram of all foods, we can conclusively answer
many bitter debates, including the imperishable question ""is a hotdog a
sandwich?"" The answer: yes."

millennia, and despite the connection between it and the full moon, the
astronomical community has afforded very little attention to lycanthropy. We
hope to address this deficiency by using the population of known exoplanets as
a natural experiment to better characterize what properties of the moon are
necessary to trigger a transformation into a werewolf. We additionally
investigate which exoplanets are most likely to have exomoons which may cause
werewolves, with a particular focus on LHS 1140 b. We also propose a new
mission called the Werewolves From Infrared Radiation and Spectral-typing
Telescope, or WFIRST, in order to better characterize exoplanetary systems.
This will allow us to explore the impact of stellar type on lycanthropy more
than it has traditionally been considered. We believe this represents a major
step forward in our understanding and recognition of the burgeoning field of
exocryptozoology."
