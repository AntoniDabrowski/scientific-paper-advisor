two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions (DFs), the gapless and spin-helical
nature of which yields many exotic phenomena, such as the immunity of
topological surface states (TSS) to back-scattering. This leads to their high
transmission through surface defects or potential barriers. Quantum corrals,
previously elaborated on metal surfaces, can act as nanometer-sized electronic
resonators to trap Schr\""odinger electrons by quantum confinement. It is thus
intriguing, concerning their peculiar nature, to put the Dirac electrons of TSS
to the test in similar circumstances. Here, we report the behaviors of TSS in a
triangular quantum corral (TQC) fabricated by epitaxially growing Bi bilayer
nanostructures on the surfaces of Bi2Te3 films. Unlike a circular corral, the
TQC is supposed to be totally transparent for DFs. By mapping the electronic
structure of TSS inside TQCs through a low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscope in the real space, both the trapping and de-trapping behaviors of
the TSS electrons are observed. The selection rules are found to be governed by
the geometry and spin texture of the constant energy contour of TSS upon the
strong hexagonal warping in Bi2Te3. Careful analysis of the quantum
interference patterns of quasi-bound states yields the corresponding wave
vectors of trapped TSS, through which two trapping mechanisms favoring momenta
in different directions are uncovered. Our work indicates the extended nature
of TSS and elucidates the selection rules of the trapping of TSS in the
presence of a complicated surface state structure, giving insights into the
effective engineering of DFs in TIs."

spin bath of the h-BN host. As the coherence time is one of the most
fundamental properties of spin qubits, the short T2 time of VB- significantly
limits its potential as a promising spin qubit candidate. In this study, we
theoretically proposed two materials engineering methods, which can
substantially extend the T2 time of the VB- spin by four times more than its
intrinsic T2. We performed quantum many-body computations by combining density
functional theory and cluster correlation expansion and showed that replacing
all the boron atoms in h-BN with the 10B isotope leads to the coherence
enhancement of the VB- spin by a factor of three. In addition, the T2 time of
the VB- can be further enhanced by inducing a curvature around VB-. Herein, we
elucidate that the curvature-induced inhomogeneous strain creates spatially
varying quadrupole nuclear interactions, which effectively suppress the nuclear

are a rapidly developing qubit platform in two-dimensional materials for
solid-state quantum applications. However, their spin coherence time (T2) is
very short, limited to a few microseconds owing to the inherently dense nuclear
spin bath of the h-BN host. As the coherence time is one of the most
fundamental properties of spin qubits, the short T2 time of VB- could
significantly limit its potential as a promising spin qubit candidate. In this
study, we theoretically proposed two materials engineering methods, which can
substantially extend the T2 time of the VB- spin by four times more than its
intrinsic T2. We performed quantum many-body computations by combining density
functional theory and cluster correlation expansion and showed that replacing
all the boron atoms in h-BN with the 10B isotope leads to the coherence
enhancement of the VB- spin by a factor of three. In addition, the T2 time of
the VB- can be enhanced by a factor of 1.3 by inducing a curvature around VB-.
Herein, we elucidate that the curvature-induced inhomogeneous strain creates
spatially varying quadrupole nuclear interactions, which effectively suppress
the nuclear spin flip-flop dynamics in the bath. Importantly, we find that the
combination of isotopic enrichment and strain engineering can maximize the VB-
T2, yielding 207.2 and 161.9 {\mu}s for single- and multi-layer h-10BN,
respectively. Furthermore, our results can be applied to any spin qubit in
h-BN, strengthening their potential as material platforms to realize
high-precision quantum sensors, quantum spin registers, and atomically thin
quantum magnets."

interesting quantum phenomena, including the infrastructure associated with
making relevant measurements. With the technology laid out, further
improvements in both infrastructure and standards were achieved in the previous
two decades as EG-based quantized Hall resistance (QHR) devices became
established as national standards. Since the metrology community has reached
some understanding that a comparison against GaAs-based QHR devices had been
accomplished, the next steps became clearer as far as how the EG-based QHR with
a single Hall bar could be further developed. Since the early 90s, it has been
of modest interest that QHR devices have a means of interconnecting several
single Hall bar elements and has since been a subject of research. NMIs are now
presently at a juncture where consideration must be granted beyond just
simplicity of operation. A natural direction for resistance standards would be
to increase the total accessible parameter space. This means using EG-based QHR
devices to output more than the single value at the $\nu = 2$ plateau (about
12.9 k$\Omega$). A first natural question is whether one may use the $\nu = 6$
plateau or $\nu = 10$ plateau, and though some work has been done with these
Landau levels in graphene, they simply do not offer the same level of precision

compatibility with industrial fabrication, and prospect to integrate classical
control electronics. To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent
mid-range link that moves the electrons between qubit registers has been
suggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here, we present a blueprint of
such a $\approx 10\,\mu$m long link, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is
based on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. To control
these sets, only a few voltage control lines are needed and the number of these
sets and thus the number of required control signals is independent of the
length of this link. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin
qubit shuttle: A qubit conveyor, i.e. a potential minimum that smoothly moves
laterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a
series of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former
approach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device including
potential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO$_2$ layer, as well as
typical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity in the conveyor
shuttling mode, we discuss in detail motional narrowing, the interplay between
orbital and valley excitation and relaxation in presence of $g$-factors that
depend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from
spin-hotspots. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9 \% is feasible in
Si/SiGe at a speed of $\sim$10\,m/s, if the average valley splitting and its
inhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic
field $\approx 20$\,mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting
is favourable for reaching high transfer fidelities."

statistics in the quantum Hall effect. The interference phase is interpreted as
a combination of a quantized statistical phase and an Aharonov-Bohm phase,
proportional to the device area and the charge of the anyons propagating along
the device edge. This interpretation faces two challenges. First, the edge
states have a finite width and hence the device area is ill-defined. Second,
multiple localized anyons may be present in states that overlap with the edge,
and it may not be clear whether a second anyon traveling along the edge will go
inside or outside the region with a localized anyon and therefore whether or
not it should pick up a statistical phase. We show how one may overcome both
challenges. In a case where only one chiral edge mode passes through the
constrictions defining the interferometer, as when electrons in a constriction
are in a Laughlin state with $\nu=1/(2n+1)$ or the integer state at $\nu=1$, we
show that the interference phase can be directly related to the total electron
charge contained in the interferometer. This holds for arbitrary
electron-electron interactions and holds even if the bulk of the interferometer
has a higher electron density than the region of the constrictions. In contrast
to the device area or to the number of anyons inside a propagating edge
channel, the total charge is well-defined. We examine, at the microscopic
level, how the relation between charge and phase is maintained when there is a
soft confining potential and disorder near the edge of the interferometer, and
we discuss briefly the complications that can occur when multiple chiral modes
can pass through the constriction."

mobility, and Fermi velocities, which are different in each coordinate due to
the out-of-plane buckling structure. We also analyze how the average effective
mass and Fermi velocities of the charge carriers in the buckling structure are
affected by the external magnetic field. It is shown that the polaronic energy
becomes more effective in presence of a magnetic field, which we confirm
through an analytical prescription. The characteristics of the evolution of

(magnetoconductance) with heavy tails (intermittency) and signatures of a
hierarchical structure (a cascade) in the corresponding stochastic process,
akin to Kolmogorov's theory of fluid turbulence. We confirm this picture by
interpreting the stochastic process of the conductance increments in the

incorporates the basic features of Kolmogorov's theory. The multifractal

belonging to different particle-number sectors can hybridize, which causes
topological anticrossings in the spectrum. The resulting spectral gaps support
chiral edge excitations whose wavefunction is a superposition of states in the
two hybridized sectors. This situation is realized in fully saturated
spin-anisotropic quantum magnets without spin conservation, in which single
magnons hybridize with magnon bound pairs, i.e., two-magnon bound states. The
resulting chiral edge excitations are exotic composites that carry mixed
spin-multipolar character, inheriting spin-dipolar and spin-quadrupolar
character from their single-particleness and two-particleness, respectively. In
contrast to established topological magnons, the topological effects discussed
here are of genuine quantum mechanical origin and vanish in the classical
limit. We discuss implications for both intrinsic anomalous Hall-type transport

insulator (QAHI) or the axion insulator, has motivated different schemes to
introduce magnetism into topological insulators. One scheme is to introduce
ferromagnetic dopants in topological insulators. However, it is generally
challenging and requires carefully engineered growth/heterostructures or
relatively low temperatures to observe the QAHI due to issues such as the added
disorder with ferromagnetic dopants. Another promising scheme is using the
magnetic proximity effect with a magnetic insulator to magnetize the
topological insulator. Most of these heterostructures are synthesized so far by
growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and metallic organic chemical
vapor deposition. These are not readily applicable to allow mixing and matching
many of the available ferromagnetic and topological insulators due to
difference in growth conditions and lattice mismatch. Here, we demonstrate that
the magnetic proximity effect can still be obtained in stacked heterostructures
assembled via the dry transfer of exfoliated micrometer-sized thin flakes of
van der Waals topological insulator and magnetic insulator materials
(BiSbTeSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6), as evidenced in the observation of an anomalous Hall
effect (AHE). Furthermore, devices made from these heterostructures can allow
modulation of the AHE when controlling the carrier density via electrostatic
gating. These results show that simple mechanical transfer of magnetic van der

insulators by magnetic proximity effect, a key step towards further realization
of novel topological phases such as QAHI and axion insulators."

magnetic imaging across entire vdW flakes, ideal for capturing changes in the
micromagnetic structure due to an electric current. Here we use a widefield NV
microscope to study the effect of current injection in thin flakes ($\sim10$nm)

coercivity on an individual domain level, where current injection in FGT causes
substantial reduction in the magnetic field required to locally reverse the
magnetisation. We then explore the possibility of current-induced domain-wall
motion, and provide preliminary evidence for such a motion under relatively low
current densities, suggesting the existence of strong current-induced torques
in our devices. Our results illustrate the applicability of widefield NV
microscopy to imaging spintronic phenomena in vdW magnets, highlight the
possibility of efficient magnetization control by direct current injection
without assistance from an adjacent conductor, and motivate further

liquids. It implies an additional unanticipated ""tomographic"" transport regime

even-parity modes are overdamped while odd-parity modes are collisionless. We
derive expressions for both the longitudinal and the transverse conductivity

from zero sound in the collisionless regime to hydrodynamic first sound in the
tomographic and hydrodynamic regime, where odd-parity damping appears as a
subleading correction to the lifetime. In charged Fermi liquids with long-range
Coulomb coupling, these modes reduce to plasmons with a strongly suppressed
odd-parity correction to the damping. The transverse response, by contrast, has
a specific tomographic transport regime with two imaginary odd-parity modes,
one of which requires a finite repulsive interaction, distinct from both the
shear sound in the collisionless regime and an overdamped diffusive current
mode in the hydrodynamic limit. Our work demonstrates that there are deep
many-body aspects of interacting Fermi liquids, which are often thought to be

magnons for quantum information processing. An important issue is to examine
the stability of quantum states of magnons against various relaxation and
dephasing channels. Since the interaction of magnons in magnetic systems may
fall in the ultra-strong and even deep-strong coupling regimes, the relaxation
process of magnon states is quite different from the more common quantum
optical systems. Here we study the relaxation and dephasing of magnons based on
the Lindblad formalism and derive a generalized master equation that describes
the quantum dynamics of magnons. Employing this master equation, we identify
two distinct dissipation channels for squeezed magnons, i.e., the local
dissipation and collective dissipation, which play a role for both ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets. The local dissipation is caused by the independent
exchange of angular momentum between the magnonic system and the environment,
while the collective dissipation is dressed by the parametric interactions of
magnons and it enhances the quantumness and thermal stability of squeezed
magnons. Further, we show how this formalism can be applied to study the pure
dephasing of magnons caused by four-magnon scattering and magnon-phonon
interactions. Our results provide the theoretical tools to study the
decoherence of magnons within a full quantum-mechanical framework and further
benefit the use of quantum states of magnons for information processing."

decreasing thickness; when the defect density is high such that bulk conduction
dominates, resistivity increases in as conventional metals. Below d_c, the

energy before they can be extracted to make electricity. The aim of hot-carrier
solar cells is to extract the carriers before this energy loss, thereby turning
more energy into electrical power. This requires extracting the carriers in a
nonequilibrium (nonthermal) energy distribution. Here, we investigate the
performance of hot-carrier solar cells for such nonequilibrium distributions.
We propose a quantum transport model in which each energy-loss process (carrier
thermalization, relaxation, and recombination) is simulated by a B\""uttiker
probe. We study charge and heat transport to analyze the hot-carrier solar
cell's power output and efficiency, introducing partial efficiencies for
different loss processes and the carrier extraction. We show that producing
electrical power from a nonequilibrium distribution has the potential to
improve the output power and efficiency. Furthermore, in the limit where the
distribution is thermal, we prove that a boxcar-shaped transmission for the
carrier extraction maximizes the efficiency at any given output power."

the effect of inevitable subtract defects in PL spectra, but a proper
understanding and a convenient way are still lacking. Here, we systematically
studied the effect of surface defects by gradually increasing the separation
between WS2 monolayer and substrate. Hence, we could precisely modulate the
exciton and trion contribution in the PL spectra of WS2. The excitation power
dependant measurements on dielectric engineered and patterned substrates helped
us to shed light on the mechanism of PL modulation in monolayer WS2. We have
also studied the influence of the nature of the charge carried by substrate

findings will be useful for fabricating excitonic interconnects, valleytronic,

study the effect of this magnetism on the spin-dependent band structure near
the Fermi energy and identify the magnetic phases induced in BLG by proximity
with magnets. We show that spin polarization can develop in BLG due to this
proximity effect. This spin polarization depends strongly on the layer
distribution of magnetism, and can always be controlled by gate voltage which
shifts spin-dependent band edges and modifies the total band gap. We further
show that the band spin polarization can be modified by the proximity-induced
staggered sublattice potential. By taking full advantage of layer-dependent

future molecular machines, their modeling has not been sufficiently studied.
Here, we develop a dynamical model to describe these systems. We illustrate the
validity and usefulness of our model by applying it to a well-known molecular
motor, showing that the obtained results are consistent with the available
experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate how to use our model to extract
some difficult-to-access microscopic parameters. Finally, we include an

suggests that, although nonconservative contributions of the CIFs can be
important in some scenarios, they do not seem important in the analyzed case.
Despite this, the conservative contributions of CIFs could be strong enough to
significantly alter the system's dynamics."

nonlinear KI device operation in high magnetic fields has received virtually no

both nondegenerate and degenerate parametric amplification, at magnetic fields

noise compromising their coherence properties and inducing quantum gate errors.
We present here a co-modelling framework for double quantum dot (DQD) devices

potential solver, full configuration interaction quantum mechanical methods and
two-level-fluctuator models to study the quantum gate performance in realistic
device designs and operation conditions. We utilize the developed models
together alongside the single electron solutions of the quantum dots to
simulate one- and two- qubit gates in the presence of charge noise. We find an
inverse correlation between quantum gate errors and quantum dot confinement
frequencies. We calculate X-gate fidelities >97% in the simulated Si-MOS
devices at a typical TLF densities. We also find that exchange driven two-qubit
SWAP gates show higher sensitivity to charge noise with fidelities down to 91%

insulator-to-insulator transitions with band inversion, and this problem is
finally reduced to five point groups $C_3, C_4, C_6, S_4$, and $C_{3h}$. We
show how the change of the $Z_2$ topological invariant at a band inversion is
completely determined by the irreps of occupied and unoccupied bands at the
high-symmetry point. For example, in the case of $C_3$, we showed that the
$Z_2$ topological invariants change whenever the band inversion occurs between
two Kramers pairs whose $C_3$ eigenvalues are $\{e^{\pi i / 3}, e^{-\pi i /
3}\}$ and $\{-1, -1\}$. These results are not included in the theory of
symmetry-based indicators or topological quantum chemistry."

opposite spin or pseudospin cross at the Fermi level, the dominance of the
exchange energy can lead to a ferromagnetic, quantum Hall ground state whose
gap is determined by the exchange energy and has skyrmions as its excitations.
This is normally achieved via applying either hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial
strain. We study here a very high-quality, low-density, two-dimensional hole
system, confined to a 30-nm-wide (001) GaAs quantum well, in which the two
lowest-energy Landau levels can be gate tuned to cross at and near filling
factor $\nu=1$. As we tune the field position of the crossing from one side of
$\nu=1$ to the other by changing the hole density, the energy gap for the
quantum Hall state at $\nu=1$ remains exceptionally large, and only shows a
small dip near the crossing. The gap overall follows a $\sqrt{B}$ dependence,
expected for the exchange energy. Our data are consistent with a robust quantum
Hall ferromagnet as the ground state."

presence of a low magnetic field ($B$) using semiclassical Boltzmann transport
formalism. The resulting dispersion at the merging point exhibits semi-Dirac
behavior which is quadratic in the $x$-direction and linear in the
$y$-direction. We find that the combined effects of the intrinsic anisotropic
spectrum, Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment (OMM) lead to finite NL
conductivities in the system. We obtain exact analytical expressions of linear
and second-order NL conductivities which allow us to analyze their dependence
on Fermi energy and system gap parameter $\delta_0$. The topology of the Fermi
surface for $\delta_0>0$ changes from two disjoint Fermi contours to a single
one across a saddle point as the Fermi energy is increased. This feature is
reflected in the nature of obtained conductivities through a kink in their
variations with Fermi energy. We find that the geometric mean (ratio) of Drude
conductivities along the $x$ and $y$ directions is independent of $\delta_0$
for low (high) doping. Interestingly, we show that the ratio of the anomalous
velocity and Lorentz force-induced NL Hall conductivity to the NL anomalous
Hall conductivity is independent of $\delta_0$ and inversely related to Fermi
energy only. For current along the $x$-direction, the NL longitudinal and Hall
resistivities show $B$-linear and $B^0$ dependences respectively in the lowest
order of $B$. However, for current along the $y$-direction, the longitudinal NL
resistivity has no contribution in both zeroth and linear order of $B$ while

interface spectrum in the vicinity of the Weyl nodes. We study these effects
with a lattice model which we solve numerically on a finite sample and
analytically through using an ansatz on an infinite sample. Our ansatz agrees
very well with the numerical simulation as it accurately describes the
behaviour of the chiral state, from its energy asymmetry to the spin canting at
the interface. We find that the tunnelling effectively increases the Fermi arc
length, allowing for the presence of interface states beyond the bare Weyl
nodes. These additional states may carry current along the interface and their
contribution can be detected in the conductance. Across the interface, the
spin-independent conductance reproduces the results of an electron tunnelling

discrete, particle-hole symmetric states, known as Andreev bound states (ABSs).
An ABS can be found in its ground or excited states of different spin and
parity, such as a spin-zero singlet state with an even number of electrons or a
spin-1/2 doublet state with an odd number of electrons. Considering the
difference between spin of the even and odd states, spin-filtered measurements
have the potential to reveal the underlying ground state. To directly measure
the spin of single-electron excitations, we probe an ABS using a spin-polarized
quantum dot that acts as a bipolar spin filter, in combination with a
non-polarized tunnel junction in a three-terminal circuit. We observe a
spin-polarized excitation spectrum of the ABS, which in some cases is fully
spin-polarized, despite the presence of strong spin-orbit interaction in the
InSb nanowires. In addition, decoupling the hybrid from the normal lead blocks
the ABS relaxation resulting in a current blockade where the ABS is trapped in
an excited state. Spin-polarized spectroscopy of hybrid nanowire devices, as
demonstrated here, is proposed as an experimental tool to support the
observation of topological superconductivity."

While providing a better grasp on the disorder-induced phenomena that have been
stirring the literature on dirty Dirac-Weyl semimetals for the past decade, this work
also serves to raise a new set of questions, which call for further research.","Most
notably, these are shown to generate a shorter optical gap, ending at ω = |EF |, whose
threshold frequency corresponds to momentum non-conserving transitions between
scattering states and the vacancy-induced nodal eigenstates.","In the
following, we divide these questions into two major avenues.",2022-12-21 21:51:10+00:00,Quantum Effects of Impurities and Lattice Defects in Topological Semimetals,cond-mat.mes-hall,"['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.dis-nn', 'physics.comp-ph', 'quant-ph']",[arxiv.Result.Author('J. P. Santos Pires')],"Topological semimetals are a class of novel three-dimensional (3D) electronic
phases that feature topologically protected conical band-touchings at the Fermi
level. These band-touching points are monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum
space and effectively realize (3+1)-dimensional Weyl fermions as emergent
quasiparticles. Such features are robust to perturbations but not completely
insensitive to them. In this thesis, we explore the yet fertile ground of
disordered Weyl semimetals (WSMs), most notably by analysing the effects of
on-site random fields, random smooth potential regions, point-like scalar
impurities, and lattice point-defects in their electronic structure and
electrodynamic properties."
