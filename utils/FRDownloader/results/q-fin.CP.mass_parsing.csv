derivatives under an affine, multi-factor term-structure model. With a
traditional dynamic hedge, the replication portfolio needs to be updated
continuously through time as the market moves. In contrast, we propose a
semi-static hedge that needs rebalancing on just a finite number of instances.
We show, taking as an example Bermudan swaptions, that callable interest rate
derivatives can be replicated with an options portfolio written on a basket of
discount bonds. The static portfolio composition is obtained by regressing the
target option's value using an interpretable, artificial neural network.
Leveraging on the approximation power of neural networks, we prove that the
hedging error can be arbitrarily small for a sufficiently large replication
portfolio. A direct, a lower bound, and an upper bound estimator for the
risk-neutral Bermudan swaption price is inferred from the hedging algorithm.
Additionally, closed-form error margins to the price statistics are determined.
We practically demonstrate the hedging and pricing performance through several
numerical experiments."

crude oil future market, which is the third most traded crude oil futures after
WTI and Brent. As China's first crude oil futures accessible to foreign
investors, the Shanghai crude oil futures (SC) have attracted significant
interest since launch at the Shanghai International Energy Exchange. The impact
of COVID-19 on the new crude oil futures is an important issue for investors
and policy makers. Therefore this paper studies the short-term influence of
COVID-19 pandemic on SC via multifractal analysis. We compare market efficiency
of SC before and during the pandemic with the multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis and other commonly-used random walk tests. Then we
generate shuffled and surrogate data to investigate the components of
multifractal nature in SC. And we examine cross-correlations between SC returns
and other financial assets returns as well as SC trading volume changes by the
multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis. The results show that market
efficiency of SC and its cross-correlations with other assets increase
significantly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Besides that, the sources of its
multifractal nature have changed since the pandemic. The findings provide
evidence for the short-term impacts of COVID-19 on SC. The results may have
important implications for assets allocation, investment strategies and risk
monitoring."

11483,"Here, we
provide the reasoning: although the majority of the credit rating datasets are able to be explained by well-learned linear
models due to their good interpretability, a small portion of the datasets still contain some non-linear patterns that should
be fed into deeper machine learning methods for further study, as the linear model cannot explain this small portion well.","To answer the above question, we utilized the novel idea of a selective
learning framework, bridging the gap between well-understood logistic regression and a black-box neural network.","Non-linearity eﬀects, such as the diminishing marginal eﬀect, are commonly observed in credit scoring datasets.",2022-09-21 05:35:46+00:00,Interpretable Selective Learning in Credit Risk,q-fin.CP,"['q-fin.CP', 'cs.AI']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Dangxing Chen'), arxiv.Result.Author('Weicheng Ye'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jiahui Ye')]","The forecasting of the credit default risk has been an important research
field for several decades. Traditionally, logistic regression has been widely
recognized as a solution due to its accuracy and interpretability. As a recent
trend, researchers tend to use more complex and advanced machine learning
methods to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Although certain non-linear
machine learning methods have better predictive power, they are often
considered to lack interpretability by financial regulators. Thus, they have
not been widely applied in credit risk assessment. We introduce a neural
network with the selective option to increase interpretability by
distinguishing whether the datasets can be explained by the linear models or
not. We find that, for most of the datasets, logistic regression will be
sufficient, with reasonable accuracy; meanwhile, for some specific data
portions, a shallow neural network model leads to much better accuracy without
significantly sacrificing the interpretability."
