one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1D-NLSE) of the focusing type

add a small linear pumping term to the equation and start evolution from
statistically homogeneous Gaussian noise. After reaching a certain level of
average intensity, we switch off the pumping and examine the resulting
integrable turbulence. For sufficiently small initial noise and pumping
coefficient, and also for not very wide simulation box (basin length), we
observe that the turbulence grows in a universal adiabatic regime, moving
successively through the statistically stationary states of the integrable
1D-NLSE, which do not depend on the pumping coefficient, amplitude of the
initial noise or basing length. Waiting longer in the growth stage, we transit
from weakly nonlinear states to strongly nonlinear ones, characterized by a
high frequency of rogue waves. Using the inverse scattering transform (IST)
method to monitor the evolution, we observe that the solitonic part of the
wavefield becomes dominant even when the (linear) dispersion effects are still
leading in the dynamics and with increasing average intensity the wavefield
approaches a dense bound-state soliton gas, whose properties are defined by the
Fourier spectrum of initial noise. Regimes deviating from the universal
adiabatic growth also lead to solitonic states, but solitons in these states
have noticeably different velocities and a significantly wider distribution by
amplitude, while the statistics of wavefield indicates a much more frequent
appearance of very large waves."

propagating on an unstable wavefield background. As a model, we use the
two-component extension of the one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger
equation -- the Manakov system. With the dressing method, we generate the
multi-breather solutions to the Manakov model. As shown previously in [D.
Kraus, G. Biondini, and G. Kovacic, Nonlinearity 28, 310, 2015] the class of
vector breathers is presented by three fundamental types I, II, and III. Their
interactions produce a broad family of the two-component (polarized) nonlinear
wave patterns. First, we demonstrate that the type I and the types II and III
correspond to two different branches of the dispersion law of the Manakov
system in the presence of the unstable background. Then we investigate the key
interaction scenarios, including collisions of standing and moving breathers
and resonance breather transformations. Analysis of the two-breather solution
allows us to derive general formulas describing phase and space shifts acquired
by breathers in mutual collisions. The found expressions enable us to describe
the asymptotic states of the breather interactions and interpret the resonance
fusion and decay of breathers as a limiting case of infinite space shift in the
case of merging breather eigenvalues. Finally, we demonstrate that only type
$\mathrm{I}$ breathers participate in the development of modulation instability
from small-amplitude perturbations within the superregular scenario, while the
breathers of types $\mathrm{II}$ and $\mathrm{III}$, belonging to the stable
branch of the dispersion law, are not involved in this process."
