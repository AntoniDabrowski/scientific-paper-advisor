In this paper, we have shown that when the spaces of measurements are totally
bounded and large enough to ensure that any two points can be distinguished
by our measurements, we can always assume that we are considering compact
perception pairs and compact spaces of GENEOs, provided that the set of
our operators is collectionwise surjective.","Of course, the computation costs might be higher while working with com-

bounded space of measurements, which is also rich enough to endow the common
domain with a metric structure, can be isometrically embedded in a compact
perception pair. Likewise, we prove that if the images of group equivariant
non-expansive operators in a given space form a cover for their common
codomain, then the space of such operators can be isometrically embedded in a
compact space of group equivariant non-expansive operators, such that the new
reference perception pairs are compactifications of the original ones having
totally bounded data sets. Meanwhile, we state some compatibility conditions
for these embeddings and show that they too are satisfied by our constructions."
