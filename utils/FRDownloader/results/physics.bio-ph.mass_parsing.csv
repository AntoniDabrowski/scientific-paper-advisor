Adar'), arxiv.Result.Author('Jean-François Joanny')]","We formulate an active-gel theory for multicellular migration in the
extra-cellular matrix (ECM). The cells are modeled as an active, polar solvent,
and the ECM as a viscoelastic solid. Our theory enables to analyze the dynamic
reciprocity between the migrating cells and their environment in terms of
distinct relative forces and alignment mechanisms. We analyze the linear
stability of polar cells migrating homogeneously in the ECM. Our theory
predicts that, as a consequence of cell-matrix alignment, contractile cells
migrate homogeneously for small wave vectors, while sufficiently extensile
cells migrate in domains. Homogeneous cell migration of both extensile and
contractile cells may be unstable for larger wave vectors, due to active forces
and the alignment of cells with their concentration gradient. These mechanisms
are stabilized by cellular alignment to the migration flow and matrix
stiffness. They are expected to be suppressed entirely for rigid matrices with
elastic moduli of order 10 kPa. Our theory should be useful in analyzing
multicellular migration and ECM patterning at the mesoscopic scale."

controlled by various guiding cues within the cell. Here, we review how protein

binary mechanical model system. In biological systems, many protein switches
equilibrate with cellular forces, yet the statistical mechanical problem
relevant to this system has remained unsolved. A binary mechanical model system
establishes a limited number of macroscopic parameters into which structural

experimental ex-vivo approaches have been applied to numerous alveolar
geometries over the past years. They aimed to study and examine airflow
patterns, particle transport, and particle-alveolar wall deposition fractions.
These studies are imperative to both pharmaceutical and toxicological studies,
especially nowadays with the escalation of the menacing COVID-19 virus.
However, most of these studies ignored the surfactant layer that covers the
alveoli and the effect of the air-surfactant surface tension on flow dynamics
and air-alveolar surface mechanics. The present study employs a realistic human
breathing profile of 4.75 to emphasize the importance of the surfactant layer
by numerically comparing airflow phenomena between a surfactant-enriched and
surfactant-deficient model. The acinar model exhibits physiologically accurate
alveolar and duct dimensions extending from lung generations 18 to 23. Proximal
lung generations experience dominant recirculating flow while farther
generations in the distal alveolar region exhibit dominant radial flows. In the
surfactant-enriched model, surface tension values alternate during inhalation
and exhalation. In the surfactant-deficient model, only water coats the
alveolar walls. Results showed that surfactant deficiency in the alveoli
adversely alters airflow behavior and generates unsteady chaotic breathing
through the production of vorticities, accompanied by higher vorticity and
velocity magnitudes. In addition, high air-water surface tension in the
surfactant-deficient case was found to induce higher shear stress values on the
alveolar walls than that of the surfactant-enriched case. Overall, it was
concluded that the presence of the surfactant improves respiratory mechanics
and allows for smooth breathing and normal respiration."

the ideal-solution limit, where interactions between the solutes are
negligible. However, there is a large variety of phenomena in biological cells
and soft-matter physics which appear to deviate from the ideal-solution
behaviour. Particularly striking is the case of liquid-liquid phase separation,
which is typically caused by inter-particle interactions. Here, we revisit a
number of known results in the domain of ideal CRNs, and we generalise and
adapt them to arbitrary interactions between the solutes which stem from a
given free energy. Among these is the form of the steady-state probability
distribution and Lyapunov functions for complex-balanced networks, where the
creation and annihilation rates are equal for all chemical complexes which
appear as reactants or products in the CRN. Finally, we draw a phase diagram
for complex-balanced reaction-diffusion solutions based on the minimisation of
such Lyapunov function with a rationale similar to that of equilibrium
thermodynamics, but for systems that may sustain non-equilibrium chemical
currents at steady state. Nevertheless, we find that complex-balanced networks
are not sufficient to create diffusion currents at steady state."

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and machine learning (ML) can
distinguish multiple pathogen species and strains, but processing complex fluid
samples to sensitively and specifically detect pathogens remains an outstanding
challenge. Here, we develop an acoustic bioprinting platform to digitize
samples into millions of droplets, each containing just a few cells, which are
then identified with SERS and ML. As a proof of concept, we focus on bacterial
bloodstream infections. We demonstrate ~2pL droplet generation from solutions
containing S. epidermidis, E. coli, and mouse red blood cells (RBCs) mixed with
gold nanorods (GNRs) at 1 kHz ejection rates; use of parallel printing heads
would enable processing of mL-volume samples in minutes. Droplets printed with
GNRs achieve spectral enhancements of up to 1500x compared to samples printed
without GNRs. With this improved signal-to-noise, we train an ML model on
droplets consisting of either pure cells with GNRs or mixed, multicellular
species with GNRs, using scanning electron microscopy images as our ground
truth. We achieve >=99% classification accuracy of droplets printed from
cellularly-pure samples, and >=87% accuracy in droplets printed from mixtures
of S. epidermidis, E. coli, and RBCs. We compute the feature importance at each

classification correspond to biologically relevant Raman peaks within our

enabling flight. In the dipteran indirect flight mechanism, the thorax acts as
a transmission link between the flight muscles and the wings, and it is often
thought to act as an elastic modulator: improving flight motor efficiency
thorough linear or nonlinear resonance. But as peering closely into the
drivetrain of tiny insects is experimentally difficult, the nature of this
elastic modulation, and any associated resonant effects, are unclear. Here, we
present a new inverse-problem methodology to surmount this difficulty. In a
data synthesis process, we integrate experimentally-observable aerodynamic and
musculoskeletal data for the fruit fly D. melanogaster, and identify several
surprising properties of the fly's thorax. We find that fruit flies have an
energetic need for flight motor resonance: energy savings due to flight motor
elasticity can be up be to 30%. However, the elasticity of the flight muscles
themselves is sufficient - and sometimes more than sufficient - to ensure
flight motor resonance. In fruit flies, the role of the thorax as an elastic
modulator is likely to be insignificant. We discover also a fundamental link
between the fruit fly wingbeat kinematics and musculature dynamics: wingbeat
kinematics show key adaptions, including in wing elevation angle, that ensure
that wingbeat load requirements match musculature load output capability.
Together, these newly-identified properties lead to novel conceptual model of
the fruit fly's flight motor: a strongly-nonlinear structure, resonant due to
muscular elasticity, and intensely concerned with ensuring that the primary
flight muscles are operating efficiently. Our inverse-problem methodology sheds
new light on the complex behavior of these tiny flight motors, and provides
avenues for further studies in a range of other insects."

model based on signaling that reliably generates different cell type patterns

fate decision model for two cell types. A detailed steady state analysis on the
resulting dynamical system yielded necessary conditions to generate spatially
heterogeneous patterns. This allows the cell type proportions to be controlled
by a single model parameter. Cell-cell communication is realized by local and
global signaling mechanisms. These result in different cell type patterns. A
nearest neighbor signal yields checkerboard patterns. Increasing the signal
dispersion, cell fate clusters and an engulfing pattern can be generated.
Altogether, the presented model allows to reliably generate heterogeneous cell
type patterns of different kinds as well as desired proportions."
