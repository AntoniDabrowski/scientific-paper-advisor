anti-inflammatory cytokine production, while ADORA2B was previously found to
contribute to Complete Freund’s adjuvant induced inflammatory pain [11]. However,
this protein is loosely relevant and is very broad and common in bodily functions, so a
further study may not be fruitful at all. Overall, we encourage the first two mentioned proteins to take part in future
research, as any newly uncovered property will expose a deeper understanding in the
dynamics of neuroinflammation. ",q-bio.OT,A,-0.13713053,-0.12556735,-0.10474745

candidate against the Omicron variant. While these hypotheses hold great value and may provide
significant insights into the therapeutic strategies, further research is crucial to authenticate these
statements. Conclusion
The world is now afraid of the highly infectious omicron variant, and research is required to know

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00027v1,"Mind the gap: how multiracial individuals get left behind when we talk about race, ethnicity, and ancestry in genomic research","Multiracial individuals
are often removed during preliminary quality control (QC) steps which stratify based on race,
ethnicity, or a homogeneous genetic ancestry grouping.5,18 In the absence of these groupings,
investigators often assign a label – such as by principal components using recent machine
learning methods. If an individual’s determined genetic ancestry does not fit cleanly within a
cluster, they are dropped from further analysis.19

         Once past the constraints of data processing and QC, multiracial individuals often also
find themselves excluded from the discovery stage. It is common to stratify large-scale genomic
studies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), by either genetic ancestry with often
arbitrary cut-offs, or by race/ethnicity.18 However, newer methods now allow the pooling of
individuals from multiple genetic backgrounds, leveraging shared ancestry across groups.22 The
discretization of genomic data along racial and/or ethnic lines can also hinder the benefits for
precision health.16 For example, polygenic scores (PGS) often rely on previous GWAS which
compounds the exclusion of multiracial individuals by relying on previous groupings and carrying
forward those definitions when composing a reference distribution of genetic risk.2

regarding ‘lumping and splitting’ individuals, and the extent to which individuals should be grouped
for data to be meaningful. ",q-bio.OT,A_centroid,-0.27034676,-0.16472736,0.51472616
