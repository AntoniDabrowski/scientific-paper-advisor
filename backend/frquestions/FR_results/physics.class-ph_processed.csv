According to Helmholtz theorem every suitably regular vector ﬁeld u(r) admits

the representation:

                        u = ∇φ + ∇ × S                  (15)

where φ is the scalar potential and S is the vector potential for which we can
assume that ∇ · S = 0 without loss of generality. For the further analysis it will be enough to assume that in the inﬁnite
domains representation (15) can be introduced under assumptions of weak decay
conditions for the displacement ﬁeld u that are used in classical elasticity [6],
though the validity of Helmholtz theorem for the ﬁelds with sub-linear growth
have been also established [52, 53]. Substituting (15) into (1) and using standard vector calculus identities we
obtain equilibrium equations in terms of potentials:

∇2 α(1 − l2∇2)∇φ + (1 − l2∇2)∇ × S = − b12              (16)
                                                 µ

    Equation (16) can be reduced to the high-order equation with respect to the
single vector function W (r) by using the following deﬁnitions of potentials φ

                        6
and S :                         φ = 1 (1 − l2∇2)∇ · W

                                S = −(1 − l12∇2)∇ × W

Combining (16), (17) we obtain:

                        (1 − l2∇2)(1 − l2∇2)∇2∇2W = − b12                  (18)

Using (15), (17) we found:

              u = 1 (1 − l2∇2)∇∇ · W − (1 − l2∇2)∇ × ∇ × W2     1          (19)
