of both porphyrin molecules and artificial graphene nanoflakes. Firstly, the magnetic properties
of porphyrin molecules are still open to further research works. For example, the magnetic

metastable 1s2s 1, 3S atomic states giving rise to the two peaks at 1.6 eV and 2.4 eV by 1+2’
photoionization. For further analysis of the low-energy part of the TRPES, we refer to our
recent paper on the relaxation dynamics of superexcited He droplets.32 In this phase, ICD
begins to outcompete photoionization and ICD electrons reappear. The time constant of
ICD can be determined from the reappearance time following depletion.41 For every pump-

of characteristic patterns for speciﬁc delays as an unbiased assistant to the human
