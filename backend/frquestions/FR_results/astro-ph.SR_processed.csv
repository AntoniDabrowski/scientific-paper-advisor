http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00178v1,Imaging the Sun's near-surface flows using mode-coupling analysis,"In this work, we have developed inversions to show that the Cartesian approximation of mode-coupling can be used
with great conﬁdence to investigate ﬂows near the surface. Careful inversions of mode-coupling measurements, built
using a suﬃciently large modeset that penetrates into the deeper layers of the convection zone, can also enable probing
of the depth structure and time-evolution of supergranules, part of future work. With enough modes to improve
signal-to-noise through larger observation sizes, we suggest that Cartesian mode-coupling can ﬁnd local helioseismic

with the period of about 40 s. We interpret these oscillations as the result of a higher-order MHD mode modulating the average
electric ﬁeld in the loop, and, hence, modulating the number of energetic electrons, which produce GS emission during the
energy release stage (about 100s). Our key ﬁnding here is the existence of these oscillations, and this opens up the several signiﬁcant areas for future work,
including more detailed studies of observables. We believe that the kink mode is more likely to be responsible for the longer
period MW pulsations, while fast oscillations observed immediately after onset of reconnection are caused either by higher-order
kink or sausage mode. ",astro-ph.SR,B,0.2753457,-0.06929115,0.0032234904

theoretically and observationally, asteroseismic studies of those stars. Some clear variabilities, classiﬁed here as ambiguous variabilities, that point to a rather diﬃcult discrimination among
rotation, pulsation or other signatures, should be revisited in future works, especially using additional observations
with signiﬁcantly larger time spans. The present ﬁndings reinforce previous studies carried out by diﬀerent authors,
showing that the detection of stellar rotation variability depends strongly on instrumental characteristics, such as
photometric sensitivity, time span of the observation, LC reduction and post-treatment procedures, and even on the

many other details of the PSP observations, e.g. the
higher proton temperature in the switchback patches,
the higher baseline solar wind speed, the alpha-particle
variability, are more diﬃcult to understand and require
further analysis in conjunction with observations of the
corresponding source regions at the Sun. Moreover, fu-
ture study of the generation frequency of the prominence
bubbles is necessary. ",astro-ph.SR,B,0.033730228,-0.11080575,-0.26057208
