   In Section 3, we ﬁrst give some basic properties of JN(p,q,s)α(X), including the monotonicity on
the subindices p, q, and s (see Proposition 3.1 below), the limit behavior as p → ∞ (see Propo-

sition 3.2 and Corollary 3.4 below), and the invariance on the second subindex q (see Proposition
3.5 below). Moreover, for the case s = 0, P(Qs)(| f |) = | f |Q is closely connected with the maximal

function MQ( f ), and hence we further study the relation between JN(p,q,s)α(X) and maximal func-
tions. On one hand, the maximal operator is bounded on Lq(X) with q ∈ (1, ∞) but not bounded on
L1(X). ",math.FA,B,0.03624968,-0.14298964,-0.07893545
