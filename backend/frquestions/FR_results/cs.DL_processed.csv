that WeChat indicators have a strong social media focus, rather than a scholarly focus (Wouters

distributions, strong correlations within social media metrics) (Díaz-Faes et al., 2019; Costas et
al., 2016; Haunschild & Bornmann, 2017; Thelwall, 2021). This observation, made for the first
time on a local social media platform, calls again for further research on the fundamental aspects
of social media metrics that are independent of their global or local orientation. As such, the
potential existence of such fundamental aspects could pave the way towards generalized social
media metrics theories and frameworks (e.g., like the framework of “heterogeneous couplings”
recently proposed by Costas et al., 2020), which could be relevant to explain and work both

Public Interest Technology for Municipal Events

from publicly available information, but none have specifically focused on aggregating transcripts of legislative
discussion. In the following section we review four of these applications, and note how they relate to but differ from

We presented the Open Research Knowledge Graph, an infrastructure that
makes the ﬁrst steps of a larger research and development agenda that aims
to transition document-based scholarly communication to a knowledge-based
information representation. In future work, we will include additional techniques
from machine support to content creation and curation (such as NLP tools to
suggest/annotate relevant concepts on behalf of users). Furthermore, we will
further develop novel features such as state-of-the-art comparisons (Figure 3). ",cs.DL,A,0.05380281,-0.12815711,-0.24683917
