resulting in higher yields per volume of the polymers when using SDBS instead of SDS as a
cosurfactant, where SDBS outperforms SDS in view of competition with DOC. Since these results indicate that the size of the bile salt surfactant molecules determines which
SWCNT diameters show a distinct transition point and, as a result, can be efficiently separated,
future work thus requires this bile salt surfactant to be altered to allow for other chiralities to be
purified to the highest purities in a two-step procedure. Also, the influence of other parameters,
such as addition of salts, temperature and pH, can be studied in the same systematic manner to
allow for a future predictive sorting of specific SWCNT chiralities. ",cond-mat.mes-hall,C,0.10907412,0.0057530957,-0.036212273

that for crystalline SiO2 (and even more for graphene) τrel is approximately gear-
size independent, while for amorphous SiO2 τrel becomes smaller with decreasing
gear size. This behavior is related to the decreasing degree of surface corrugation
when going from amorphous SiO2 to crystalline SiO2 and to graphene. ",cond-mat.mes-hall,C,0.1266905,0.25636643,-0.2600343
