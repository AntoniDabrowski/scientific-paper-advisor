that the operation of horizontal linkage over a Gorenstein local ring preserves the Ulrich

modules. It also provides, in dimension at least 2, a characterization of Gorenstein rings in
terms of linkage of Ulrich modules in the classical sense. ",math.AC,B_centroid,0.31061035,-0.40224633,0.3127404

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02463v1,Essential ideals represented by mod-annihilators of modules,"Conclusion: In this paper, we formulated a new approach of recognition of essential ideals
in a commutative ring R. This formulation of essential ideals corresponds to mod-annihilators
of a R-module M. It is interesting to characterize essential ideals such that their arbitrary inter-
section is an essential ideal, since it is speciﬁed in [4] that an arbitrary intersection of essential
ideals may not be an essential ideal. Furthermore, we obtained the results related to ideals
[x : M] of R, where x is a mod-annihilator of M and discussed the representation of vertices
of annihilating graphs by essential ideals of R. Apart from the research problems which we
mentioned in Sections 2 and 3, the following problems could be investigated for the future work. 1. ",math.AC,A_centroid,-0.20477672,-0.36341202,-0.17393684
