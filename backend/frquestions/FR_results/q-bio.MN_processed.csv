An advantage of large causal molecular networks is drug discovery and repurposing. Previous
approaches to identifying drugs have been focussed on correlating transcription signatures between
disease and known drugs (66) however this approach generates drugs and therapeutic targets that
rarely are further researched, and have not had much success in brining any new treatments to the
clinic. Causal pathways allow for more in-depth identification of drug targets. ",q-bio.MN,A,-0.30808568,0.0049695503,-0.2681081

The tropicalization method decomposes the phase space into polyhedra within

span several orders of magnitude and therefore the resulting reduced models are
