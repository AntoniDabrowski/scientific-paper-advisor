Theorem 1.1 follows from a computation of the triangular basis transition matrix, which
is a combinatorial exercise handled in Section 2.1. We hope that our result may be extended in future work into a more general un-
derstanding of the elusive links between Harish-Chandra–Howe character distributions,
Iwahori–Hecke algebra representation theory and invariants arising from degenerate Whit-
taker models. In that context we mention a related work of Ciubotaru–Mason-Brown–
Okada [CMBO21] on the role of Arthur packets in the description of the wavefront set for
Iwahori-spherical representations. ",math.RT,B,-0.24851191,-0.138719,-0.08120954
