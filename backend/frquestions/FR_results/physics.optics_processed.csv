4.1 Volumetric 3D deconvolution

The beauty of holography is that it offers the possibility of restoring 3D objects from their 2D
holograms, as often demonstrated in optical art holography. In digital holography, however, when a
2D hologram is numerically reconstructed instead of a 3D object, the object wavefront is
reconstructed and further analysis is required to extract the 3D object itself. The reconstruction of
digital holograms is achieved via the calculation of integral transformations, as described above (Eqs. ",physics.optics,A,-0.011278157,0.4053986,-0.14564222

contributes to all components of the Poynting vector, in particular, it manly determines the
core mode energy flux in the transverse direction and, correspondingly, the waveguide loss of

transverse component of the Poynting vector can serve as an efficient tool for establishing the
relationship between the cross ‚Äì section structures of SC MOFs and the position of singular
points at which minimal losses are obtained for leaky mode in a given spectral range. Acknowledgements

enables the realization of resonance-free colour filters. In terms of engineered disorder, exploring
nontrivial material states defined in the temporal domains, such as hyperuniformity34 and stealthy30,
