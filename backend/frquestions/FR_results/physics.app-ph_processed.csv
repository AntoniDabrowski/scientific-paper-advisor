We have demonstrated that TDDFT calculations agree reasonably well with the experimental

TDDFT-optimized small molecular acceptors (NFAs) and donor oligomers collected over the

absorption relationships by means of statistical and machine-learning (ML) methods. Through
the exploration of molecular descriptors, we identify two features that are strongly correlated
with εd,𝑚𝑎𝑥, namely the linearity and planarity of the molecule in the direction of maximum
atomic polarizability variance; and the number of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms bonded to two
other carbons included in the molecule. ",physics.app-ph,C,-0.052828223,0.022161156,0.15127835

gives insight into inhibition strategies focusing on enhancing the diﬀusion of lithium ions to achieve a more
uniform concentration ﬁeld on the anode surface, leading to lower dendrite formation propensity [80, 81, 82,
83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93]. Given our understanding of the process, in future work we may add other physical aspects to the
simulation; our 3D phase-ﬁeld model coupled with additional ﬁelds will allow us to gain insight into other
aspects of dendrite formation and assess some of the proposed strategies for dendrite suppression. Thus,
strategies from 2D phase-ﬁeld models available in the literature could be followed; for example, the current
model does not consider heat transfer to simulate the thermal eﬀect during the lithium dendrite growth
process. ",physics.app-ph,A,-0.32463592,0.076578826,0.14092258
