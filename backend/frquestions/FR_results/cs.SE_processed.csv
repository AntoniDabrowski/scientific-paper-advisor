condition on natural language instructions and other indications of human intent [76, 65, 48]. Finally,
our model lays a foundation for future work on supervised inﬁlling & editing via model ﬁne-tuning,
as well as performing iterative decoding, where the model can be used to reﬁne its own output [27]. Acknowledgments

we presented our implementation of these tools: xPACE and TASC Modeler. As future work, we plan to apply the tools in different projects and evaluate their
quality attributes, in particular time behavior, capacity, and scalability when they have
to deal with much bigger contextual datasets. References
