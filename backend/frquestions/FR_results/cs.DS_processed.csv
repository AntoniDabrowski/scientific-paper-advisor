comparing this heuristic with the asymptotically exact algorithm from [16] in practice,

In this paper, we presented new approximation algorithms that substantially improve upon cur-
rently known results for the Fair Max-Min problem both in general and Euclidean metric spaces. There are several interesting directions for future work, including obtaining a 2-approximation for
the problem in general metrics or improving the hardness result. Another direction is to generalize the fairness constraints to arbitrary matroid constraints (the
fairness constraints considered in this paper can be expressed via the special case of a partition
matroid). ",cs.DS,C,0.054856535,-0.35331702,-0.2898541

ML-enhanced sorting is a novel approach competing against implementa-
tions that have been extensively tuned. There is room for algorithmic inno-
vation in ML-enhanced sorting, hence future work might make it even more
competitive with other approaches. There are limitations to using Learned Sort. ",cs.DS,A,0.17636152,0.12299364,0.039561246

particular, we are also the ﬁrst to design space-eﬃcient deletion robust algorithms for non-monotone
objective with any type of constraints. A natural direction for future work is to extend these results
and ideas to other constraints (e.g., multiple matroids and knapsack), and to consider fully dynamic
versions with insertions and deletions. Acknowledgements

techniques can be used to obtain quadratic algorithms for related problems, such
as computing orthogonal drawings with the minimum number of bends [7,9]. References
