and in turn pathwidth is an upper bound on treewidth. Thus all of the hardness results
in this section also apply with relation to these graph parameters – we aim to identify the
corresponding complexity classes for the parameterization by treewidth in future work. 4.1 XNLP-completeness of t-Positive Inference
