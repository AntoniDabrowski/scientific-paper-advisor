two weakenings of single-peaked domains that complement each other, and expand
the scope of applications to models where the restriction of single-peakedness is too
demanding (see for instance, multidimensional voting under constraints and allocation
of public goods on a transportation network). We leave the detailed exploration of
these applications to future work. This methodology also may be useful beyond the
speciﬁc issue of classiﬁcation of non-dictatorial domains that we studied here; for
instance, within the voting model it could be used to explore the structure of locally

even in general contexts we expect to have complete and complete balanced bipartite
networks when a social planner is able to choose the network structure. However, as
shown in Proposition 1, choosing the optimal partition when φ < 0 is NP-hard, and
further research could identify approximation algorithms to reduce computational difﬁ-
culty. Finally, since our analysis of the distributional effects in Section 4 largely focuses
on comparisons with the maximally equitable outcome in which all players obtain the

run and operate under normal conditions; (b) continues to make an attack probabilistically

diﬃcult including forked-chain attacks and (c) can be indicated by the number of rounds a

mechanism needs to run to conﬁrm a block – that is, in the absence of an attack, there will

be few rounds while an attack with a close to 51 percent majority will still likely take many

rounds. We believe that it would be possible to calculate these probabilities more precisely

but that is left for future work. 11

Measuring aspects of complex systems, and in particular economic ones, is a challenging task but
potentially provides useful information for understanding the phenomena that occur in these systems. The analysed formulas, and in particular Formula 10, showed good performance and,
therefore, can be used to describe and study the structure of economic ecosystems - or even perhaps
other types of ecosystems. ",econ.TH,C,0.061015822,-0.13849515,-0.3067037
