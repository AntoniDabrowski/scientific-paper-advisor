    The study of mechanical vibrations is one of the classic fields of mechanical engineering. Problems of how
vibrations impact a material, such as changing the entire vibrational behavior of a simple spring-mass system due to
an external force, are grounds for further study. A simple change in initial conditions can lead to abrupt changes in
vibration amplitudes, which is one of the characteristics of a nonlinear system, such as pointed by researches made
