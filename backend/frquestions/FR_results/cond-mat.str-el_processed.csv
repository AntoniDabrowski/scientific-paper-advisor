The main conclusion that can be drawn from this expression is that now behavior does not depend only on ¬µ/T
relation, but contains additional temperature dependence in Ô¨Årst term. To perform further analysis, we reduce the
complexity of expression by expanding it around ¬µ = 0 for symmetric vHs case D+ = D‚àí:

exciton incompressible state at ŒΩex = 1, i.e., one exciton per moir√© site, a hallmark of a bosonic
correlated insulator. We further study the phase diagram spanned by ŒΩe and ŒΩex and observe a
mixed Mott insulator along the path of ŒΩtot = ŒΩex + ŒΩe = 1. Owing to the large exciton binding
energy and strong correlation here, the bosonic Mott insulator persists to above 30 K, orders of
magnitude higher than previous studies in cold atoms and quantum wells(24, 25). ",cond-mat.str-el,B,0.17607646,0.009974528,-0.3781196

of long-range CDW order. However, the strong increase of the superlattice peak prohibits further analysis of in- or
quasi-elastic scattering at lower temperatures with the given energy resolution, because the much weaker quasi-
elastic scattering is hidden under the tail of the elastic peak. The temperature dependences of the soft mode‚Äôs
