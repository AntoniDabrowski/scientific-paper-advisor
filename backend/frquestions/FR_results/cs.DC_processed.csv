quantity and performance, would provide an even higher improvement. As future work, it would
be useful to come up with a way to build arbitrary fractal structures by combining diÔ¨Äerent NBB
fractals at each scale level, as well as to extend Squeeze to support compact processing on 3D and
higher-dimensional fractals. As a Ô¨Ånal conclusion, the proposed approach can be adopted by the
community to accelerate simulations on NBB fractals and understand phenomena at larger scales. ",cs.DC,B,-0.27031696,0.14180976,-0.10458835

challenges around ensemble scheduling on modern HPC machines, where we
demonstrated that the Ô¨Çexibility provided by the two workÔ¨Çow systems working
in combination is a powerful enabler for such situations. For future work we
believe that it would be worthwhile to integrate the CWL and marshalling and
control workÔ¨Çows, not necessarily at the underlying technology level but instead
exploiting some of the safety provided by CWL deÔ¨Ånitions to ensure that those
workÔ¨Çows expressed in the marshalling and control system are suitable. Acknowledgements The research leading to these results has received funding
