essential for analyzing and determining disease occurrence and progression. Due to
the technical restrictions and various economic and physical conditions, there exist
several challenges in obtaining a good quality diagnostic image like low resolution

faulty or older scanning equipment etc, which can often render diagnostic scans not

is fueled by the need to, (1) address the challenge of data sparsity, inaccuracy and incompleteness; (2) harness the ever-
growing number of sensors with different modality to achieve solutions free of moderation by experts. To this end, based on this review, we provide a few recommendations for the future works in this research line: (1)
Developing domain adaptation approaches taking advantage of the unique characteristics of RS data, such as their
diversity in land patterns of different geographical regions, the availability of low-resolution labels for semi-supervised
DA, available height information globally, as well as physics-based spectrum signatures in the RS world. (2) Exploring
the underlying mechanisms of spectrum diversity across different sensors, to achieve inter-sensor calibration prior to
