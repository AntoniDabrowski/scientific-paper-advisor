     The overarching goal of this paper is to assess the existing SRSWL literature in order to provide
insights to researchers, TNCs, transit agencies, planners, and policymakers and ultimately identify the
most critical future research directions. To meet this goal, this paper reviews existing studies, delineates
the components of the underlying operational problem (Section 2), discusses computational challenges
(Section 2.2), classifies SRSWL by service configuration (Section 3), and identifies a series of potential
modelling and algorithmic challenges worthy of further research (Section 4). The review focuses on
models and algorithms related to the design, planning, and operation of SRSWL, along with studies
analyzing the societal/system impacts of SRSWL. ",eess.SY,B,0.35759342,-0.1660324,-0.16375914
