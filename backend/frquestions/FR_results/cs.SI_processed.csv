http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02172v2,Facebook's Architecture Undermines Vaccine Misinformation Removal Efforts,"By analogy, in the short term,
Facebook or public health officials might consider using social media platforms to engage
directly with users who have been repeatedly exposed to misinformation, and may attempt to
recruit vaccine hesitant individuals into other venues where their needs for community can be
met, while ensuring that their questions about vaccines are answered in a manner that is most
consistent with public health guidelines.25,53 In the longer term, platforms may incorporate
explicit features designed to promote communities that organically resist misinformation.54
There is nevertheless a dearth of scientific literature regarding specific interventions to reduce
demand for misinformation among active seekers. Thus, future work is needed to develop
interventions that can work in tandem with both ‚Äúhard‚Äù and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù content remedies to reduce
misinformation seeking behaviour. References

Reconciling the Quality vs Popularity Dichotomy

8 Conclusions and future work

In this paper we have shown that a small effort on behalf of users to discriminate quality out of popularity can, in
the long run, straighten out systems that, by themselves, could drift to undesirable conÔ¨Ågurations containing severe
misalignments, especially among the top-quality items. Readers familiar with load balancing strategies might recognize an analogy between our Ô¨Åndings and the so called
‚Äúpower of two choices"" paradigm [50], which has been applied also to other computer science problems, such as hashing
and shared memory machines [51]. ",cs.SI,C,-0.13739446,0.14014763,0.16456507
