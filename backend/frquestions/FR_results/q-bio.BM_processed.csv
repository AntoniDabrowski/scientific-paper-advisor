http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12474v1,Thirty years of molecular dynamics simulations on posttranslational modifications of proteins,"Phosphorylation was seen to induce conformational changes in a
10-residue region of tyrosine hydroxylase where most metastable states depicted peptide
compression after 5 ps of simulation, unlike what was seen in the unphosphorylated structure.193
Salt bridges seen in the unphosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase peptide were broken, leaving many
charged residues solvent-exposed as the pSer moiety hydrogen bonded with terminal residues. New interactions and conformations caused by Ser phosphorylation at one tyrosine hydroxylase
site were argued to be the cause for cooperative increases seen in experimental phosphorylation at
additional sites along the peptide region.193 Peptide compression in response to phosphorylation

has been reported in additional studies spanning from 2002 to 2012, too, as well as the breaking
of native salt bridges in order to generate hydrogen bonds for mitigating the negative charge of
phosphate groups.194,195 Other forms of conformational change for Ser phosphorylation have been
reported, such as stabilized alpha-helical secondary structure formation based on phosphate-
backbone electrostatic interactions,196 as well as preferred dihedral orientations introduced at the
phosphorylation site.197 Thr-specific phosphorylation was also seen to increase helicity in 100 ns
classical simulations of p53 and p73 proteins, although decreases in helical content have been seen
for other proteins.198,199 Even as recent as 2019 has the interplay of individual PTM forms been
found to stabilize N-terminal helices through phosphate charge neutralization and backbone-
sidechain hydrogen bonding via advanced REMD simulations.200 From the large body of
phosphorylation modeling and simulation research, modification along specific amino acids and
in different local environments will alter the probabilities of distinct resulting conformations. Work
from the Jacobson group using umbrella sampling and quantum mechanical studies found in 2007
that hydrogen bond strength with phosphate groups noticeably changes in response to the geometry
assumed by different phosphorylated residues based on their amino acid identity and their local
environments.201 Similarly, REMD simulations on glycosylated proteins also showed in 2010 that
protein secondary structure can be altered in a site-specific manner based on shifted backbone
dihedral preferences after glycosylation.202

Intrinsic disorder and repositioning of flexible loops serve as strategies for proteins to rapidly
change their local environments in response to dynamic processes. ",q-bio.BM,B,-0.13569884,-0.20035416,-0.099729314
