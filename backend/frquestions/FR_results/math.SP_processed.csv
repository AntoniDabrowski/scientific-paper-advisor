http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00457v1,An Improvement of the Resolvent Estimate in the Kreiss Matrix Theorem,"The new resolvent estimate can be used to derive sharper estimates
for well-posed Cauchy problems. As future work, it is unknown how the sharpest constant K in the
estimate (2.3) depends on the dimension n. It would also be interesting to know how the results in
this paper can be generalized to certain classes of linear operators on Hilbert space. Acknowledgments. ",math.SP,C,-0.42015433,-0.27748805,0.12472403

into asymptotics (6.7), we get (1.4). APPENDIX

       This Appendix is devoted to the asymptotics of the characteristic function D. Since the boundary
conditions of the operator H are not symmetric, the classical methods for ﬁnding the trace formula
require additional research. This will be the subject of a separate work. ",math.SP,C,-0.32613117,-0.36471975,-0.4109399

larger pattern, though further research is needed to establish it fully. Let us now consider the 78 pairs of L–mates with N = 10; Figures 7 and

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11739v1,Spectral Characteristics of Schrödinger Operators Generated by Product Systems,"As noted above, this scenario
corresponds to sampling functions that are separable as in (1.1.5); however, in each of the three
instances, we are able to prove results that cover a larger class of continuous functions on the
product space. Although we investigate product systems in which one factor is a shift on a cyclic group, we
emphasize that there are other natural choices for factors generating product systems of interest in
mathematical physics that we hope will be addressed in future work. In the ﬁrst case, we consider subshifts satisfying the Boshernitzan condition and full shifts over
ﬁnite alphabets. ",math.SP,A_centroid,-0.23933557,0.25280598,0.7265732
