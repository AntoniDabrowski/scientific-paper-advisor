The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the DMD formulation, a brief description of the
test cases is given in Section 3, DMD and statistical analysis details are provided in Section 4, Section 5 presents the
numerical results, and ﬁnally, conclusions and possible extension for future work are discussed in Section 6. 2 Dynamic Mode Decomposition

Consider a dynamical system described as
                                                             dx = f (x, t; µ), (1)
                                                             dt

where x(t) ∈ Rn represents the system’s state at time t, µ contains the parameters of the system, and f (·) represents
its dynamics. ",math.DS,B,-0.20734888,0.12883589,-0.34588352
