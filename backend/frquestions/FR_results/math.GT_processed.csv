possible to generalise that result to the Lawrence-Krammer representation of Bn for all n (which is known
to always be faithful), in which case it might be used to develop a general test for link invertibility or to give
a faster solution to the conjugacy problem in Bn for all n.

cobounded action on a metric space X such that the following hold:

    (1) Morse and strongly contracting sets are equivalent in X, and
    (2) pseudo-Anosov elements of G all have strongly contracting quasi-axes in X. This theorem further highlights the signiÔ¨Åcance of [HHP20] and encourages further study
of injective metric spaces in light of their recent inÔ¨Çuence on geometric group theory. On this
note, we point out that although this may not be apparent from their construction, the ideas
behind recent work of [PSZ22] constructing hyperplanes and hyperbolic models for CAT(0)
spaces originate from the study of injective metric spaces and their d8-like distance. ",math.GT,A,-0.019341597,0.39444107,-0.2592265
