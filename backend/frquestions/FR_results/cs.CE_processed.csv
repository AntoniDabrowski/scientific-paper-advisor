In this section we provide further analysis of the performance of NeurVec from three aspects: (1) NeurVec maintains
the statistic of the solutions from large-scale simulation, which is crucial for constructing reliable models; (2) NeurVec
learns the leading error term of the numerical solver, which enables a more accurate estimation for each step; and
(3) we compare the evaluation time and solution error among solver with ﬁne or coarse step size and NeurVec. Ensemble forecast with NeurVec. ",cs.CE,C,-0.098305926,-0.12908012,-0.11901666

2 Numerical formulation: Diffusive phase transformation modeling

DSSPT modeling at the mesoscopic scale typically involves two governing equations: a diffusion equation that governs
the partitioning of solute atoms (such as carbon) across different phases, and another governing equation that takes
care of the resulting interface network migration. ",cs.CE,B,0.15023999,0.06839191,0.13192347

discovered regimes as being likely to be unproﬁtable; however, more complex trading strategies, for example using
derivatives-based hedging, could potentially make use of these regimes. Finally, and most importantly for future work,
the KAMA+MSR model’s ability to smoothly and accurate distinguish regimes will allow it to be used as a regime
label generator for machine learning tasks in which the aim is to predict such regimes ex ante. References
