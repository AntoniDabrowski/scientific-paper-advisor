5. Conclusions & further research
In the context of a more human-centric Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet pyramid proposed in
this study argues that an enterprise's transformation from an Automated Factory into a Smart
Factory will occur when there will be no more information asymmetry within and among
technology, process and people, thus achieving a fully (or quasi-fully) coupled human-machine
interaction. The complexity of this transformation resides not only in the lack of clear
implementation guidelines in literature and of structured information but also in enabling and
convincing enterprises and operators (more familiar with legacy systems and traditional
procedures) to easily harness this knowledge. ",cs.CY,A,-0.29015532,-0.26579723,0.024681054

Over the course of the years our collection of ESEA method diagrams has grown rapidly. The models have helped
us better understand ESEA methods and they have laid foundations for further analysis and software design and
development. The domain analysis presented in this report has enabled several project already. ",cs.CY,A,-0.19497946,-0.07617278,0.12418972

By studying article priority through the lens of English Wikipedia‚Äôs values, we show that existing
approaches for determining article importance fall short in many substantive ways. We uncover
several of the challenges inherent in using recommender systems to automate the direction of
editor effort on Wikipedia, and provide guidance for future work that centers the encyclopedia‚Äôs
values. Finally, we demonstrate that the community‚Äôs gender demographics can prevent it from

                                        work towards more trustworthy multi-AI systems by exploring some of the associated challenges and opportunities, and how we can
                                        design better mechanisms to understand and assess such systems. This paper is designed to be a first exposition on this topic in the
                                        field of humanitarian response, raising awareness, exploring the possible landscape of this domain, and providing a starting point for
                                        future work within the wider community. CCS Concepts: ‚Ä¢ Computing methodologies ‚Üí Artificial intelligence; ‚Ä¢ Human-centered computing ‚Üí Human computer

than that of DP or EOdds. We noted this in our conclusion Section 5 as an area for future work and
provide some hypotheses for methods that can address this inconsistency. Nonetheless, improving
conÔ¨Çicting deÔ¨Ånitions of fairness simultaneously is another signiÔ¨Åcant result as it provides empirical
evidence that there is a path forward towards multiple fairness. ",cs.CY,C,0.19282605,-0.08388296,-0.22124785

our methodology to the analysis of more studies than those identiÔ¨Åed here. The Ô¨Åfth issue of researcher bias also threatens the internal validity as it can sway the
results in a particular direction rather than being objective. ",cs.CY,C,0.14483148,0.3446591,-0.24334884
