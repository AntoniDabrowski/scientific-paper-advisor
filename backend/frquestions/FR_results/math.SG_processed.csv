group π0Dng is, and in particular whether the disconnectivity in Proposition 1.4 holds for
other symplectic forms in horizontal lines in the cone. We hope to explore these questions
in future works. On the line of equal size 1/2, the rank of π1(Ggµ,n) is positive (indeed at least n) for an n-fold
blowup of Mg. On the other hand, by [HK15, Corollary 3.6], if the number of blowups is
large (n ≥ µ/2), there are points on this line that do admit Hamiltonian circle actions. ",math.SG,B,-0.2505625,-0.023827514,0.06751068

relevant properties are relegated to future work. 1.6 Outline

Section 2 deﬁnes the relevant notion of ‘curved ﬁltered quasi-equivalence’ of curved ﬁltered A∞
categories, gives the construction of the uncurved A∞ category Abc of c-unital bounding cochains on
a curved ﬁltered A∞ category A, and proves that if A and B are curved ﬁltered quasi-equivalent then
Abc and Bbc are quasi-equivalent. ",math.SG,A,0.15512091,0.4613672,0.16498014

result is only proven over C.

   We end the introduction with an observation about the deformation theory of categories associated
to invertible curve singularities, although leave further exploration for future work. It seems that the
suggestion of Futaki and Ueda is not just a viable deﬁnition of the orbifold Fukaya–Seidel category,
but allows the deformations of this category to become manifest. ",math.SG,A_centroid,0.098251246,0.4157427,-0.08239236
