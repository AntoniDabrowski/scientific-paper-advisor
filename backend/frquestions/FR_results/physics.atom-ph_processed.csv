     results of correlation calculations on Tl+ and Lu+ with GRPP of 28-electron cores (main quantum number n ≤ 3)
     allow to expect that this model is suﬃciently accurate to simulate excitation energies of 6th row atoms and their
     compounds with an accuracy better than 102 cm−1. As for the case of the Ra atom, the possibility of further
     improvement of accuracy through reducing the inner core size from 60 to 28 electrons deserves additional studies;

– even for very small inner cores, the calculations with the GRPP Hamiltonian remain much less expensive than
     those with 4-component ones, at the same time ensuring a comparable accuracy of modeling low-energy elec-
     tronic excitations as the most advanced 4-component approximation. Due to the proper account of electron-
     electron interactions beyond the Coulomb term, the “tiny-core” GRPP models clearly outperform in accuracy the
     Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian. ",physics.atom-ph,C,0.098936245,0.37859893,0.016966097
