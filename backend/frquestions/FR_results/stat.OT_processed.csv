http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03512v1,SMLE: An R Package for Joint Feature Screening in Ultrahigh-dimensional GLMs,"It would be promising to
extend the application scope of SMLE to other modeling scenarios such as Cox’s models and
multivariate response regression, where the SMLE-based methodology has been discussed in
the literature. For future work, it is also of great interest to embed SMLE in a distributed
framework, so that it may help to handle the big data situation, where high-dimensional data
segments are stored in diﬀerent places. Acknowledgments

3.1 Summative assessments

One obvious question arising when considering the comparison of the two syntaxes is
whether students performed better in one section or another. The IRB for this study
did not cover examining student work (an obvious place for improved further research),
so we cannot look at student outcomes on a per-assignment basis. However, running a
randomization test for a diﬀerence in overall mean lab grades showed no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence between the two sections. ",stat.OT,B,0.7053752,-0.07712382,-0.14445613

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03072v1,Mathematical models of confirmation bias,"In general, mathematical modelling can
be the path to more detailed understanding of phenomena, such as has been
the case with infectious diseases. Models can oﬀer detailed predictions, but
more importantly they can give insight and help to focus further study. Here, however, little mathematical modelling has been done. ",stat.OT,A_centroid,-0.36801523,0.40706903,0.029808395

this point, do a more in-depth study. In order to further study the relationship between the spatial angle of the safety
evacuation sign and the information transfer efficiency and capability of the spatial direction, this paper proposes a
formula for calculating the visible area of the safety evacuation sign. Although Kubota et al. ",stat.OT,A,-0.26476657,0.61364704,-0.35877544
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05608v1,Examining the role of context in statistical literacy outcomes using an isomorphic assessment instrument,"In reference to the
discussion in Section 2.1 regarding sensitive contexts, this finding also has implications for
teaching practices. If additional research finds that the sensitivity of the topic may have
contributed to the lower scores on M-BLIS, an argument can be made to favor inclusion of
such topics on curricular materials instead of including them in grade-affecting assessments
(Fallstrom et al., 2021). From a context point of view, two things are worth noting. ",stat.OT,B,0.3773863,-0.04637416,0.0705168

integration of protoshiny into users’ current analysis workﬂows. A related direction for
future work will be to add more features to the R API for fast loading of clustering objects
and labels into the browser tool. While protoshiny does expand on the utility of dendrograms for larger data sets, a
current limitation of the tool is extreme scalability. ",stat.OT,C_centroid,-0.41070986,-0.46587247,-0.05088316
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08785v1,The Inference Framework,"Depending on the axioms that one includes in I ,♦, one could potentially con-
strain the functional form of f and f♦ further. For example, if one adopts
axioms NC and CN so that (a ∧ b) ⇔ ( a) ∧ ( b), then the form of f is
constrained to obey,

                   P ( (a ∧ b)) = f (P (a ∧ b))                   (2.152)
                                   = f (P (a))f (P (b| a))

We will not pursue these ideas any further in this thesis and instead suggest
that it be considered for future work. Degrees of beliefs for predicates? ",stat.OT,A,0.01776528,0.31752312,0.7805733
