where w = {wn}Nn=0 is the short-hand notation for the subcarriers, Mn is the cache size of
the n-th CDN, and Wtot is the total available bandwidth. In the above optimization problem,
constraint (1a) is to guarantee the minimum cache hits requirement ηn at every CDN; constraints
(1b) and (1c) states that the total amount of sent data can not exceed the caching capacity of the
wide-beam and multi-beam during the caching duration, respectively; (1d) sets the maximum of
cached data at each CDN not exceeding the cache size Mn; constraint (1e) guarantees efﬁcient
caching and avoids one ﬁle being sent through both wide-beam and multi-beam; constraint (1f)

   We have studied multi-user coding techniques and general alphabets for the mismatched rate-distortion problem,

mismatched channel coding. Several possible directions remain for future work, including (i) studying the reﬁned

various ensembles provably outperform one another; and (iii) extending the results for the constant constant-

cooperative FD-SWIPT technologies for NOMA systems. Since this work focused on a setting of one antenna at the
BS, perfect CSI and perfect SIC, the impact of deployment of multi-antennas, imperfect SIC on the RIS phase-shift

     the cell-center device cooperates with the cell-edge device without harming itself in terms
