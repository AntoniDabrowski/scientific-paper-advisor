weighted approach, the provided algorithm takes into account the weight uncertainties. The resulting query
works using the concept of dominance and tries to include in the result set also interesting results within a

model databases is urgent. The efficient utilization of the systems requires a pre-

experimented and analyzed potential solutions to support FAIRification. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview
of the FAIRification workflow; Section 3 describes the actions established for each step

logs is an objective that can be pursued in following endeavors. Finally, an
interesting avenue for future work is to explore the possibility of correlating the
events solely based on constraints, without prior knowledge of the whole process
model or by means of declarative process rules [68]. Acknowledgements

In general, querying techniques can be categorised across two families: (i) the
ﬁrst concerns querying as we know it in databases and information retrieval;
(ii) the second, a family where workﬂows, namely Data Science (DS) workﬂows,
explore and analyse the data to proﬁle them quantitatively either with mod-
elling, prediction, or recommendation purposes. ",cs.DB,B,-0.04292756,0.23362082,-0.18840937
