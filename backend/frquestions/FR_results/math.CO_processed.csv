the class of tournaments, so Theorem 3.2 yields the result of [7] (see (3.1)) stating that H is a hero in
tournaments if and only if all of its strong components are. Then, by induction, we get the same result for

7 Concluding remarks

Our methods for bounding product-free subsets of the alternating group have justiﬁed the intuitive idea that globalness
can be regarded as a pseudorandomness notion, by showing estimates on the eigenvalues of Cayley operators for global
sets that correspond to the intuition for random sets. Given the large literature on random Cayley graphs inspired by
the seminal paper of Alon and Roichman [1], one natural direction for further research is whether analogous results
hold for Cayley graphs with respect to global sets. We also propose the study of extremal problems for word maps in general groups (see the survey of Shalev [12]
for background). ",math.CO,A,0.12590727,0.08114901,0.087974444
