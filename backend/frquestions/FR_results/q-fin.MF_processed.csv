http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00662v1,Systemic Risk Models for Disjoint and Overlapping Groups with Equilibrium Strategies,"It is impossible for individuals to stay with correlated
and uncorrelated individuals at the same time except for the trivial case when all individuals are
together. 3 Systemic Risk Measure on Overlapping Groups

To further study the systemic risk measure under exponential utility functions, we generalize the

systemic risk allocation for N individuals on disjoint groups in section 2 to the risk allocation for

them on overlapping groups where they can choose multiple groups to allocate their risks. Assuming

there are at most h groups, the weighted risk factors for the nth-individual assigned to multiple

groups are labelled as wn,kXn, k = 1, . ",q-fin.MF,B,0.22418205,-0.271838,-0.35815167

factor of 16.3. A topic that is still open to further research is the convergence of the truncated gPC expansion of the stochastic solution
to the true solution as the truncation number goes to inﬁnity. If convergence is assumed to hold, it is also possible to
solve the deterministic system of PDEs for the gPC coefﬁcients with a different numerical technique and apply the
Bi-Fidelity approach to this solution. ",q-fin.MF,A,-0.02703898,0.1925039,-0.06502231

of Theorem 2.2. Leaving this rather long analysis for future work, we prove the current statement

Reference prices in the mixed models are still computed as described in Remark 5: in the mixed
rough Bergomi model, we discretize the VIX2T,j in (3.2) for j ∈ {1, 2} with a rectangle scheme
and simulate exactly the discretized variable, while in the mixed standard Bergomi model, we
exploit the Markovian representation in Remark 5 for each term VIX2T,j, j ∈ {1, 2}, and apply
a two-dimensional deterministic quadrature with respect to the parameter u and to the space
dimension. ",q-fin.MF,A,-0.34708792,-0.12598115,-0.2686475

the optimal stopping problem, which allow for a thorough analysis. ",q-fin.MF,A,-0.1789988,0.72241694,0.06050907
