think through whether there may be ‚Äúcumulative or aggregate impacts of the
system on rights-holders and their progeny that could expand the effects of the
system beyond the scope of impact identified in the previous answers‚Äù. Identifying
cumulative or aggregate impact can be much more difficult than identifying harms
directly or proximately caused by the use of an AI system, and providing a full
answer to this question, for the project team, may involve additional research and
consultation with domain experts and other relevant stakeholders. This difficulty
results from the fact that cumulative impacts are often incremental and more
difficult to perceive, and they frequently involve complex contexts of multiple
actors or projects operating in the same area or sector or affecting the same
populations.55 Some ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù questions to reflect on when assessing
cumulative or aggregate impacts include:

evaluated on heterogeneous scenarios, characterized by a diÔ¨Äerent number of problems, dif-

are built. In this paper, starting from some surprising results presented by Liu, Amadini,

4 Open research challenges and future work
Resource allocation is usually formulated as an optimization problem. Accordingly, it is
susceptible to intractable optimization problems [110], in which problem constraints would have
to be relaxed at the cost of risking sub-optimal solutions. ",cs.AI,B,-0.0023093782,-0.001788713,-0.3536552

By establishing a lot of communication between different systems, including smart devices,
storage, servers, communication networks, IoT networks, and the advanced Internet bones and the
undeniable impact of these facilities in people's daily lives, optimizing and increasing efficiency
is a sensitive issue to be considered. In this context, there are various aspects of sensitivity such as

becomes one of the main bottlenecks in all these aspects. ",cs.AI,A,0.05307261,-0.13465238,0.005355534

proposed method can efficiently process the multi-label classification task of ICT
customer service text data and outperforms the most popular approaches. In the future work, we will concentrate on the semantic correlation between category
labels in ICT customer service data to improve classification performance. And also,
some complex neural network models based multi-label text classification will be
explored for further improving the performance of multi-label text classification based
on the power ICT customer service text data. ",cs.AI,B,-0.38963905,0.00357001,-0.1265873
