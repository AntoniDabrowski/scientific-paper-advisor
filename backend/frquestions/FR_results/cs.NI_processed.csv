vast differences in microcontroller architectures, available RAM and flash memory, it is not likely that the same API
client can be compatible with all platforms. Rather, future work would consist of creating more sub-generators, each
supporting their own branch of microcontrollers, for example by including the libraries necessary to support the
particular architecture. A place to start, would be to make an MbedOS API client generator, which is a different popular
open source framework for microcontrollers [5]. ",cs.NI,A,0.050146043,0.13690767,0.20739731
