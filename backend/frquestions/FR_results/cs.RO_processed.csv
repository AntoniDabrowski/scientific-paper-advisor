kinematic model of generic 6R serial robots will be studied to have similar conclusions on
the cuspidal nature of generic 6R serial robots. Appendix A. Singularity in the joint space: the locus of critical points

The singularity for a 3R serial robot in the joint space, the locus of critical points, can

be derived from the relation:

a performance similar to the IACA-DI model. Considering the promising outcomes of the PheroCom model, several paths can be followed in future works. These
paths can include: (i) to search an automatic method to deﬁne the amount of information exchanged between the
robots, i.e., the size of messages that robots must exchange to ensure the efﬁciency of the task performed; (ii) also
automate the values of some system variables, such as the number of robots and the evaporation rate, both related to
the dimensions and characteristics of different environments; (iii) to implement and analyse the occurrence of events
during the execution of the task, e.g., robot failure, the entry of new robots and declines in communication; (iv) knowing
that the model scales to any number of robots, future experiments intend to extend the results to larger teams (more
than 100 robots) to more accurately characterise the dynamics of a swarm; (v) to implement the PheroCom model in a
swarm-dedicated simulator (e.g., ARGoS [Pinciroli et al., 2011], since it allows real-time dynamical simulations of
up to 10.000 robots, with a suitable compromise between ﬁdelity and performance); (vi) to develop a single metric to
