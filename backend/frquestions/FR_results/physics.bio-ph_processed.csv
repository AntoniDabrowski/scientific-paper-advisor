http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12298v1,Nonextensive realizations in interacting ion channels: implications for mechano-electrical transducer mechanisms,"The scheme formulated by these authors contains two       channels on the same stereocilia connected

through a tip-link to a third channel located in the neighboring stereocilia (please see ﬁgure 1 in ([21]) for a visual

inspection). In order to study the simplest case, we chose to work with two connected MET channels, leaving the

inclusion of the third channel for future work. The ∗ parameter represents the mathematical artiﬁce to mimic

the channel’s binding, facilitated by the tip-link tension that regulates the channel interaction. ",physics.bio-ph,B,-0.026874613,0.071077585,-0.13163215
