http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06183v1,Internal multi-portfolio rebalancing processes: Linking resource allocation models and biproportional matrix techniques to portfolio management,"Given
these results, we recommend that the market-invariant process be used for such internal
rebalancing processes instead of the linear or banker process. We have left open the
question of how cash ﬂows between portfolios, between asset classes, and into or out of
the fund will aﬀect rebalancing processes, which we leave for future work. 7 Acknowledgements

promising, and demonstrate the competitive edge that our strategy has over other OLPS strategies. Nevertheless, there remain several areas for exploration in future work. First, a distributionally

current model could study the Portfolio Transformer’s performance under an
attention mechanism diﬀerent from the scaled dot-product attention currently
used. In addition, while it is popular with industry practitioners, the Sharpe
