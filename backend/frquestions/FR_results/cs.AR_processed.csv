the performance gap with Ideal-sOoO which only extracts MLP. These results highlight that further research is required for scaling sOoO cores to larger instruction windows. Furthermore, given that MLP’s contribution to overall performance reduces at large windows and that Freeway already
extracts a large portion of the available MLP, the research in scaling sOoO cores should focus on ILP rather than
capturing the MLP opportunities missed by Freeway. ",cs.AR,A,0.043830674,0.06748697,-0.07692424

the decision problems remain NP-complete for LRU for programs with procedure

EXPTIME hardness is proved only with an initially empty cache).5
