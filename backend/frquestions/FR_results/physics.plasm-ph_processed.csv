   To conclude, we have studied theoretically the excitations of the recently observed high frequency electrostatic drift
waves in an inhomogeneous plasma with a constant magnetic ﬁeld in the framework of a plasma ﬂuid model yielding
a novel nonlinear evolution equation of third order. Subsequently, for simplicity of calculations, it is seen that this
derived third order nonlinear evolution equation can be reduced to two second order equations for further analysis. 23

The most interesting fact in this context is that one reduced equation is linear admitting exact solutions whereas the
other reduced equation is nonlinear admitting both exact and approximate solutions which are explored in detail. ",physics.plasm-ph,B,-0.12421183,-0.010290844,-0.21036673

eﬀects in these devices, suggesting at least that further study into non-local parallel
transport in reactor-class tokamaks is warranted. The modiﬁcations to γe and q ,e in conjunction with good agreement in power
