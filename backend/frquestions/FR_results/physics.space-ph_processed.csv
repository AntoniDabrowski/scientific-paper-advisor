the residuals show a systematic pattern with negative residuals early in each observational season before the
peak and positive residuals after the orbit with the peak. This pattern suggests that the hypothetical contribution
from the ISN hydrogen is not eliminated and requires further analysis, beyond the scope of this paper. The model

Low (CGL) kinetic approximation of the MHD equations often applied to simulations
(Chew et al., 1956; Meng et al., 2012) might not be appropriate for the low frequencies
under consideration since the accessible volume to particles becomes essentially the en-
tire Ô¨Çux tubes. It is conceivable that appropriately modelling the cusps though might
reveal a hitherto unforeseen eigenmode corresponding to magnetosonic (or sound) waves
trapped within the cone-like cavity of each magnetospheric cusp, a challenge we leave
to future work. ‚Äì26‚Äì
