    The COHERENT experiment located in Neutrino Alley at the Spallation Neutron Source
(SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), has made the world’s ﬁrst two measurements
of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), on CsI and argon, using neutrinos pro-
duced at the SNS. The COHERENT collaboration continues to pursue CEvNS measurements on
various targets as well as additional studies of inelastic neutrino-nucleus interactions, searches
for accelerator-produced dark matter (DM) and physics beyond the Standard Model, using the
uniquely high-quality and high-intensity neutrino source available at the SNS. This white paper
describes primarily COHERENT’s ongoing and near-future program at the SNS First Target
Station (FTS). ",hep-ex,B,-0.117928386,-0.16777423,-0.34336397

the tensor meson f2(2340) is strongly produced in the radiative decays J/ψ → γηη and γφφ [5],
rendering it a good candidate for a tensor glueball. Two recent coupled channel analyses [6, 7]
of our data on radiative J/ψ decays came to diﬀerent conclusions concerning the number of
contributing resonances and the identiﬁcation of a glueball candidate, so that additional studies
using the full 10 billion J/ψ data sample will be of high importance in the future. In the search for the pseudo-scalar glueball, the decay J/ψ → γη′π+π− has proven to be
particularly interesting [8]. ",hep-ex,C,-0.067379765,-0.027031366,-0.16119684

    • electron (muon) candidates are required to have pT > 30 GeV ( pT > 26

    • electron candidates in the transition region between the barrel and
       endcap calorimeters, 1.4442 < |η| < 1.556, are excluded;

    • electron (muon) candidates are selected if they have values of relative
       isolation discriminant Irel < 0.06 (Irel < 0.15);

    • anti-kT jets with a distance parameter of 0.4 are required to have pT >
       30 GeV and |η| < 2.4;
