them into our methodologies. The veriﬁcation of scripts involving control statements is more
involved and will require a careful reﬁnement of our current methods. ",cs.SC,B,0.68810153,0.09158245,0.038331777

and will formalise key instructions to extend our approach to the whole of Bitcoin script. The

some additional work needs to be done to ﬁnd the matching of if-then-else instructions. ",cs.SC,B_centroid,0.80497795,0.031473413,-0.010555274

access to an Ore polynomial ι : φ → ψ deﬁning an isogeny — we can compute an ideal a ⊂ AH

computing an isogeny between two isogenous Drinfeld modules. ",cs.SC,C_centroid,-0.15213849,-0.57556856,-0.35927948

well-known tools used in subdivision procedures for root ﬁnding. We propose our compression algorithm not as a replacement of QIR Abbott
iterations, but rather as a complementary tool: in future work, we plan to use
compression to obtain a disc where Schr¨oder’s/QIR Abbott iterations would
converge fast. The subroutines presented in this paper laid down the path toward a Cauchy

that surprising given it is well documented that polynomials from applications
are often diﬀerent to those generated from a simple random generator. 6.2 Future work

An obvious future work is to experiment with the new heuristics on problems
with more variables, higher degree, or data from other sources. We see a number
of avenues beyond this for more research. ",cs.SC,A,-0.37434784,0.10202819,-0.050198197
