http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00746v1,Coherence of probabilistic constraints on Nash equilibria,"PCE-Coherence may be seen as an addition to this list by
Theorem 8 in Section 5 if one glimpses it as the problem of deciding whether there are at most
K + 1 mixed equilibria for which there is an associated vector π that satisﬁes conditions in (3). 7 Conclusions and future work

By means of observable games, we have modeled the scenario of uncertainty about exactly what
equilibrium is to be reached in a situation that will certainly reach one. To avoid the possible
hardness of computing and enumerating all equilibria in order to assign probabilities to them,
the proposed model instead allows the observer to assign probabilities to the possible actions of
the players involved. ",cs.GT,A,-0.2682744,-0.15666702,0.091130115
