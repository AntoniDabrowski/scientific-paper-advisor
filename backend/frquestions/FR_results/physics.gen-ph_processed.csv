speciﬁc textures Type-A3 and Type-Q2 can be obtained starting from certain symmetry groups and
attempt to realise the other textures is in progress. The textures elaborated in the present work may help the model builders to understand the ﬁrst
principle in a better way, and as a part of future work, we propose to study the stability of the
proposed textures under the renormalization group running and to study the baryon asymmetry
based upon the textures obtained in our work. Further, we can extend our work in 3 + 1 neutrino
mixing scenario with larger parameters space. ",physics.gen-ph,C,-0.36516407,0.45522594,0.04451029
