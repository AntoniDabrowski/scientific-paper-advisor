iterative method may have a reasonably wide range of applications. 6 Conclusion and future works

For two types of ill-conditioned algebraic equations, initial guesses were obtained
using a low-precision eigensolver, and it was indicated that a highly accurate
and eﬃcient direct iterative method can be accelerated by parallel computing. Considering the stability of the iterative computing process, it is possible to
speed up the eigensolver, for example, by using the approximate eigenvalues
from low-precision computation as the origin shift in high-precision computa-
tion, but the direct iterative method for algebraic equations with its computa-
tional complexity, parallelism, and ease of implementation, is also useful in long
precision computing environments. ",math.NA,B,-0.24872422,-0.3204459,-0.03039976

accuracy properties against one-dimensional and two-dimensional tests. In future works we plan to investigate extensions to high-order methods and an implicit version of the solver for the
acoustic ﬂux in order to prevent the severe CFL limitations imposed by the sound velocity in the low Mach regime. Acknowledgment

theoretically and conﬁrmed numerically that the proposed algorithm obtains monotonically
increasing value functions and converges to the optimal one. Issues regarding the eﬃciency
in multiple asset cases or how can the method be applied in a ﬁnite element context are to
be concerned in future works. In the same spirit of the iterative algorithm used here for pricing the American put
option, we are working on a further work on the solution of Stefan problem. ",math.NA,B,0.039123535,-0.10458717,-0.10435936

and should be high order accurate (with the worst scenario of losing at most one order because of the division by the
spatial mesh size to the ﬂux diﬀerences), but its eﬀect on shock resolutions should be carefully assessed numerically
and compared with the approach in [4, 5] in which the convection terms were treated by the standard high resolution
schemes with SSP RK. The second future work would be the extension of the stability analysis in this paper to the
semi-discrete schemes arising from the multispecies reactive Euler equations. The diﬃculty is the increased complexity
when the size of the ODE systems gets larger with spatial mesh reﬁnements. ",math.NA,B,0.34265465,-0.1639435,0.0071604587
