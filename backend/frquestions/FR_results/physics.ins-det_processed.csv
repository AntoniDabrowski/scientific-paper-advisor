This work introduces a new design of waves in ice instrument. This instrument is able to perform measurements of
sea ice drift using a GNSS module, and to measure waves in ice up to a high degree of accuracy (the noise threshold
corresponds to a signiﬁcant wave height of around 0.1 cm for waves with period 16 s, as demonstrated in the laboratory
experiments), using an inexpensive 9-degree-of-freedom sensor and extensive signal processing and noise reduction

why MINER𝜈A measured such a high rate of degradation as their scintillator composition is again

points as discussed above, and also anecdotally observed by MINOS [10]; and that further study
of later data would show a reduced ageing rate in line with those measured by T2K and MINOS. For completeness, if a linear ﬁt is applied only to the currently excluded Downstream ECal data
