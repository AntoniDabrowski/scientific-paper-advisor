http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11544v1,Gene Expression Time Delays in Reaction-Diffusion Systems,"However, as far as we are aware, there
is no systematic study of how time delay may aﬀect pattern formation events for
a reaction-diﬀusion mechanism with greater than two morphogens. Therefore, one
potentially important avenue for further research would be to investigate the eﬀect of
time delay on Turing mechanisms encapsulating a larger number of reactants. This

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03583v1,Scanning Electron Microscopy and Metabolite Measurement Revealed the Stress Mechanism of PS-COOH Microplastics on Rhodotorula mucilaginosa AN5,"However, the determination of physiological and biochemical indexes of yeast is
less, and the research on the coping mechanism of yeast is not involved. For further research,
proteome, transcriptome, metabolome, etc. it is necessary to reveal how yeast responds to
microplastic stress through omics research. ",q-bio.CB,A_centroid,-0.47553742,-0.21504134,0.07056406
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03583v2,Scanning Electron Microscopy and Metabolite Measurement Revealed the Stress Mechanism of PS-COOH Microplastics on Rhodotorula mucilaginosa AN5,"Through three parts of growth curve mapping, scanning electron
microscope observation and metabolite measurement, this study reached the conclusion that 80nm
carboxyl polystyrene plastic microspheres stressed the population growth, cell morphology and
oxidation emergency level of R. mucilaginosa AN5. These lay a foundation for further study on the
impact of microplastic pollution on the marine ecological environment and biological population. Reference
