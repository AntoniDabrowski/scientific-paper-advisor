3.6 Inference on Parameters

In some applications, the ultimate goal may be to make inference on the underlying parameter,
for example, to construct conﬁdence intervals for components of θ. While we defer a formal
analysis to future work, we suggest a hybrid procedure that aims at controlling the potential
distortion of the model selection step, borrowing insights from the moment selection literature
(Andrews and Soares, 2010; Romano et al., 2014). Consider  constructing  conﬁdence  intervals  for  a component  or  linear  combination  γ0  =  p  δ0
                                                    √
of δ0.13 Due to Proposition 3.1, γˆn = p δˆn is a n-consistent estimator of γ0 as long as

the true value of β is in a neighborhood of β0 whose radius is of order n−1/2. ",econ.EM,B,-0.08332387,-0.2571146,-0.014688272

cross-variable shrinkage and a data-based approach to determine the overall shrinkage
strength were empirically important. In future work, it would be useful to extend the proposed estimators to compare large
time-varying parameter VARs. Existing evidence seems to suggest that in a large VAR,
only a few of the coeﬃcients are time-varying. ",econ.EM,B,-0.2595501,-0.16391322,0.0035003554
