for the BPS quiver of the (3I2) deformation, from the fundamental domain in ﬁgure 11b,
we have a basis of BPS states given by:

                      √             √               √             (5.29)
                        2(1, 0) ,     2(−2, 1) ,      2(1, −1) ,

with the BPS quiver:

                      Eγ1=√2(1,0)                Eγ2=√2(−2,1)

                                                                  (5.30)

                                       Eγ3=√2(1,−1)

Note that this is the same quiver as (5.28), up to the renormalization of the BPS states. The charge normalization is rather peculiar in this case, an issue that we hope to clarify
in future work. Let us ﬁnally mention that this analysis can be done for Argyres-Wittig
SCFTs [138], reproducing known BPS quivers of these theories [117], based on quivers of
the Minahan-Nemeschanski theories [139]. ",hep-th,C,-0.02430166,-0.27317387,0.097524

the conformal block decomposition can be read oﬀ. ",hep-th,A,-0.33027616,0.027615793,-0.17206943
