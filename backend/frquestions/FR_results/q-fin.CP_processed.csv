6 Conclusion and future work

We have illustrated here the application of NMF to extra-ﬁnancial score data. In contrast to principal
component analysis, which focuses on risk reduction by creating mutually orthogonal factors, NMF allows
the information contained in the data to be summarized faithfully using meta-variables, where the original
variables appear as linear combinations with positive coeﬃcients. ",q-fin.CP,A,-0.034673534,0.09849344,0.026950905
