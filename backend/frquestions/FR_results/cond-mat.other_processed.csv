all other terms appearing in Eq (22) except for vb (κ) are independent of Sb . Since the
Chern number is derived from this kind of surface integral, it is expected that a certain number
describing the phase discontinuity of the magnetic Bloch function may appear for vb (κ) , but
such an investigation would be a subject of future work. In order to understand another type of anomalous velocity, we rewrite Eq. ",cond-mat.other,A,-0.3622687,-0.10146767,0.05343455
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02633v1,Bistability in orbital trajectories of a chiral self-propelled particle interacting with an external field,"The experimental results suggest that sensor location aﬀects the emergent trajectories
by imposing a preferential direction of rotation and, in addition, the stochastic component
introduces a bistability eﬀect. To further study these behaviors, a model was designed to
include the following factors: (i) alignment between sensor orientation and external ﬁeld,
and (ii) a correlated noise term to account for stochastic steps. The evolution of the position
r and the orientation n = (cos α, sin α) are

r˙ = v0 n ,                    (1)

τ0α˙ zˆ = s × ∇rI(r) + ξ zˆ ,  (2)

where v0 is the constant velocity of the particle, α is the orientation angle of the particle
n, s = (cos α + β, sin α + β) is the orientation of the sensor, τ0 is a characteristic relaxation
time, I(r) the ﬁeld intensity at distance r, and ξ Gaussian colored noise with correlation
 ξ(t)ξ(t ) = 2τDξ exp −| t−τξt | that models the stochastic steps. ",cond-mat.other,C,0.021112552,0.0469786,0.91604006
