Abstract

Recession of environmental barrier coatings (EBC) in environments containing steam is a pressing
concern that requires further research before their implementation in gas turbine engines can be
realized. In this work, free-standing plasma sprayed Yb2Si2O7 coatings were exposed to flowing steam
at 1350 °C and 1400 °C for 96 h. Three samples were investigated, one coating with a low porosity
level (< 3 %) and 1 wt.% Al2O3 representing traditional EBCs; and two coatings with higher porosity
levels (~20 %) representing abradable EBCs. ",cond-mat.mtrl-sci,B,0.13982293,-0.26970288,0.11979354

        Researchers have actively studied the electron transport properties of biological
objects for already 20 years. Nevertheless, very often experimental measurements of the

worth to become improved in future work: One is that computing NEF polyhedra can be very costly. Another one is
that meshed-based processing using ﬂoating point numbers, especially when decomposing a polyhedron into tetrahedra,
