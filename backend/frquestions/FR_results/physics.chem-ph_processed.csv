    In summary we have shown how a generative model can be used to solve the Schro¨dinger
equation by sampling the excited Slater determinants that contribute the most to the wave-
function. Numerical applications show that this approach is already competitive with previ-
ous approaches based on Monte Carlo sampling of the excited determinants26 or on machine
learning ansatzes to represent the wavefunction in the conﬁguration space.8,11 An improve-
ment that should be addressed in future work involves the development of a generative model
that intrinsically takes into account the symmetry of the determinants and, more in general,
the properties of the determinants contributing to the wavefunction. It has already been
shown that a sizeable improvement in the convergence speed can be achieved by directly
generating the determinants that couple with double and single substitutions to the deter-
minants already included in the wavefunction. ",physics.chem-ph,B,0.095754094,-0.22973917,0.0070812833
