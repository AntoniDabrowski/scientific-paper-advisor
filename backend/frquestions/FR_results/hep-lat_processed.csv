In this paper, we propose a method for calculating the generating functional in quantum ﬁeld theory and obtain the ﬁrst
two vertex functions (for two and four particles) for the case of a specially rescaled coupling constant. The answer is
very similar in form to the predictions of the renormalized perturbation theory, but everything can be expressed in terms
of the bare Lagrangian parameters. ",hep-lat,A,0.00821417,0.15670475,-0.12782845
