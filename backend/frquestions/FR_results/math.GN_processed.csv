   In this paper we interpreted some of the basic topological notions in
anti-topological setting. In this way we extended the initial research
presented in [14]. ",math.GN,B,0.13418491,0.03919719,-0.35935104
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10278v1,A categorical review of complete regularity,"Taking X to be discrete, one obtains the (endofunctor of a) monad UAb on Ab, for
which the category UAb-Spa(Ab) needs to be investigated. Since, by a well-known,
but non-trivial, result of harmonic analysis, a homomorphism f : X → Y of locally
compact abelian (lca) groups is continuous, as soon as χf is continuous for all (char-
acters) χ ∈ TopAb(Y, T), we conjecture that all lca groups lie in UAb-CFSpa(Ab),
but must leave any elaboration of this conjecture for future work. 5 External properties of complete regularity

assumptions as in Section 4, we have the diagram

Cai, Lin and He in [19] proved that every topological gyrogroup is a rectiﬁable space, which implies that the
equivalence between the axioms of ﬁrst-countable and metrizability in a Hausdorﬀ topological gyrogroup. By
further researches of the classical Mo¨bius gyrogroups, Einstein gyrogroups, and Proper Velocity gyrogroups,
Bao and Lin [8] found that each of them has an open neighborhood base at the identity element 0 such
that all elements of the base are invariant under the groupoid automorphisms with standard topology. Therefore, they posed the concept of strongly topological gyrogroups and showed that every feathered
strongly topological gyrogroup is paracompact. ",math.GN,B,-0.42404896,-0.031782944,0.005368162
