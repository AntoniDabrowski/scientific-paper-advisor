We developed general procedures to determine exact eigenstates of mixed
quantum-classical Davydov dimer for any value of the amide I quantum num-
ber n. We also determined a closed expression for the eigenenergies in this
system, namely, eq.(9). In future work, these developments will be applied
to the calculation of physical quantities such as the dependence on n of time-
dependent probabilities of excitation in each site, the localization threshold,
and absorption spectra. 18

developments in computing power and simulation algorithms it may be quite instructive to perform
a similar study with a ML model trained on higher levels of theory, such as DFT based on a hybrid
functional, coupled cluster methods, etc. Similarly, evaluating potential system size effects
