In this paper, we derive and analyze a Stackelberg equilibrium in a Stackelberg game between
a reinsurer and an insurer, which appears in the context of an equity-linked insurance product
with a capital guarantee. We assume that the reinsurance is only purchased at the beginning of
the investment horizon and is not continuously adjusted. ",q-fin.RM,A,-0.20149073,0.114641145,0.4087177

The novel contribution of this paper is to empirically analyse the impact of introducing
ML techniques to include linear and non-linear dependencies among obligors’ charac-
teristics in the credit risk evaluation of a portfolio. We perform our analysis on a set
