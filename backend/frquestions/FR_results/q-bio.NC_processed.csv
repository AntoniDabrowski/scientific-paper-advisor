neuronal cell types in speciﬁc environments; these will be pursued in future work. Even
at the current abstract level, however, we are able to predict generically that dendritic

on this now, but in future work we certainly want to explore this situation in greater depth again, especially
now that many other aspects of this situation have become clear in the meantime. Indeed, from the analysis
of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann that we made here, it appears that separated or not separated
entities will also determine the choice between these two, Maxwell-Boltzmann or Bose-Einstein (or Fermi-

scientists to establish various scientific theories. 3.2 Category Theory and Natural Transformations

      In order to study the structural characteristics of brain thinking, it is necessary to further study
the structural characteristics of scientific theories, that is, to categorize and axiomize scientific
theories. In this way, from the perspective of categorization, the isomorphic characteristics of
theoretical models of different disciplines and the categorization characteristics of brain thinking
can be shown. ",q-bio.NC,A,-0.10378705,0.1251145,-0.28614914

       in input correlations to a single layer network. We hope in future work to extend
       our laminar network model to analyze development during the critical period, and
       to understand the delayed occurrence of plasticity in layer 4 during monocular
       deprivation by considering the role of feedback from layer 2/3 to layer 4. Finally, note
       that the principles outlined in this paper could be extended to include orientation
       selectivity and spatial frequency in the visual system, and could also be employed
       to study the development of laminar structures in other cortical areas. ",q-bio.NC,A,-0.09797278,-0.18437542,0.0585749
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11411v1,Spectrum of non-Hermitian deep-Hebbian neural networks,"The
non-normal property also causes the transient ampliﬁcation, especially when the network
setting falls within the critical regime. Thus, it is also very interesting in future works to
show how these characteristics are modiﬁed when more biological constrains are considered,
such as cell types, sparseness, and excitation-inhibition balance. Acknowledgments

who may face diﬀerential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable

relative simplicity of the WC model permitted a thorough mapping of networks’ baseline dynamics in the
presence of stochastic background inputs, as well as in-depth analyses of functional state manipulation at
a variety of working points, for diﬀerent networks, and for diﬀerent perturbations. Moreover, it may even
be possible to make some analytical progress in the context of this model in future work. On the other
hand, though, only more biologically detailed models allow for (i) linking microscopic, spiking-level neuronal
activity to population-level phase-locking [13] and collective state control [15], and (ii) an understanding of
how macroscopic functional states relate to interareal communication and information ﬂow at the level of
individual spike patterns [12]. ",q-bio.NC,A_centroid,0.0447919,-0.45985293,-0.040013447
