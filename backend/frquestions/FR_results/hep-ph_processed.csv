considering that the future high energy/luminosity collider provides an ideal platform for the study of the Higgs
boson, the inclusive decay process H → b + J/ψ + ¯b + X has the potential to be found in future colliders with high
energy/luminosity. In conclusion, the process of J/ψ associated production with a bottom quark pair from the Higgs

in the investigation of the coupling for the Higgs boson with the bottom quark. Acknowledgments

measurements performed by these experiments are still world-leading. 3.2 The future kaon program at CERN
A plan for a comprehensive program to further study the rare decay modes of both K+ and KL mesons
is currently taking shape [3], to be carried out after LS3 with high-intensity kaon beams from the CERN
SPS in multiple phases, including the following:

    – an experiment to measure B(K+ → π+νν¯) at the 5% level (∼ 400 SM signal events) with a
       primary beam of intensity four times that of NA62;

    – an experiment to measure B(KL → π0νν¯) at the 20% level (∼ 60 SM signal events) with a
       primary beam of intensity six times that of NA62;

    – a hybrid phase, with the neutral beam for the KL phase and the downstream tracking and par-
       ticle identiﬁcation detectors for the K+ phase, to allow measurements of KL decays to charged
       particles, most importantly the very rare KL → π0 + − decays. 63
       This plan relies on the availability of a high-intensity, slow-extracted 400-GeV proton beam from
the SPS to the current NA62 experimental hall, which is ideally suited for the next-generation kaon
experiments. ",hep-ph,B,-0.23718604,0.08363562,-0.23258612

    • the treatment of conﬁgurations without parton-shower ordering requires detailed agreements between ﬁxed-order

    • the handling of secondary or multi-parton scattering phenomena will need to be assessed carefully, both at

    • processes with singularities at Born level (such as dijet production at the LHC) may require further developments,

    • a revised treatment of virtual ﬁxed-order corrections that spreads their eﬀects over higher-multiplicity phase

each of the cuts is at least 95% at all model points. ",hep-ph,B,-0.14402077,0.09567935,-0.164954
