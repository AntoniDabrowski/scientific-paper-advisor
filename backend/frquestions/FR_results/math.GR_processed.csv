p with ﬁxed point sets which are not necessarily preserved under non-trivial

be required to complete an analogous classiﬁcation for discrete two-generator
subgroups of PSL2(K) which contain elements of order p.

Theorem A is a consequence of the following geometric theorem with cor-
responding labelling. Here, and throughout the paper, we will use Fix(A)
to denote the ﬁxed point set of an elliptic isometry A of a tree T , and we
will respectively use l(B) and Ax(B) to denote the translation length and
axis of a hyperbolic isometry B of T . ",math.GR,B,-0.13964847,0.19354878,-0.07054866
