find the strongest support for a robust role for experts in content moderation processes, with
participants perceiving the expert panel as having high levels of trustworthiness, fairness and
impartiality, and overall perceived institutional legitimacy. Our qualitative results also indicate a
preference among users for group decision making over decisions made by individuals, supporting
future work on processes that synthesize multiple views. Our results are also consistent with prior

personal information sharing in interview, they consistently struggled to conceptualise the entirety or whole picture of
their accumulated digital traces across multiple channels and across time, and potential knock-on effects and risks. We
acknowledge that the data narrative approach was not sufficient to achieve this and in this context, we identify the
following pressing future work:

     • Demonstrate to individuals in everyday terms — perhaps by using other narrative approaches, including scenarios
        — the potential use by another agent of seemingly harmless pieces of personal information posted across
        disconnected digital traces. • Go beyond “awareness nudges” by promoting reflection before sharing, to enable people to make informed
