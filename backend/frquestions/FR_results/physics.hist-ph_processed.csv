allows physicists to look for deviations from those values of whatever kind and without any

target of further analysis—for some thing to model. It seems to us that philosophically this goal

on the same kinds of solutions as ordinary ψ-nonphysical models do: quantum ﬁelds, and vacuum ﬂuctuations in
particular, may be regarded as a form of modal structure or a manifestation of the laws of nature, so they are capable of
having physical effects (just as other sorts of modal relations and laws of nature have physical effects) but they do not
gravitate (because modal structures and laws of nature don’t have spacetime locations and don’t carry mass or energy). 5Unless we are willing to get rid of the standard formalism of QFT and replace it with something like Schwinger’s source theory [63]

We hope to examine these possibilities in greater detail in future work. 6 Conclusion

In this paper we have argued that, in the context of the tripartite analysis of the BMV experiments, ψ-complete
models generally predict that the BMV experiment will have a positive result; ψ-nonphysical models often predict
that the BMV experiment will not have a positive result; and for ψ-supplemented models there may be arguments
for either possibility, although it does seem hard to combine the requirement that there is a nonquantum sector made
up of entities travelling along continuous paths in spacetime with the existence of spacetime superpositions. ",physics.hist-ph,C,-0.018040475,-0.16118279,-0.24314815

Baroque architecture, that could have influenced the orientation preferences of the builders of
these churches. Thus is another important element worthy of further research, since natural
illumination could explain the orientation of some individual constructions of the Jesuit Order
in the region. Finally, based on the analysis of the data presented above, it could be concluded that the
orientation of the Jesuit churches of Chiquitos (and of the missions themselves) most likely
does not follow a well-defined prescription or pattern, since it appears to us that the churches
had to be adapted to each individual site and landscape, which posed a number of challenges. ",physics.hist-ph,B,0.07258996,0.2923307,0.42283416

correct reading of it, according to which it is the independent locality assumption that
allows one to derive determinism: CH clearly endorse the validity of this implication when
they aptly write that “any theory which satisfies the locality condition must also be
deterministic if certain quantum-mechanical predictions are valid for the idealized case”. Strangely enough, in the very subsequent lines they turn out to be much more ambiguous:

   Bell' s further analysis shows, however, that any deterministic local theories are necessarily
   incompatible with some other quantum-mechanical predictions for the Gedankenexperiment. Upon examining the proof in Bell's earlier paper, one might conjecture that it is essentially the
   deterministic character of the class of theories that is incompatible with quantum mechanics. ",physics.hist-ph,C,-0.056390055,-0.12464313,-0.31375274
