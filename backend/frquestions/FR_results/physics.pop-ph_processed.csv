http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04757v1,"Modern Cosmology, an Amuse-Gueule","For some authors,
these shortcomings of inﬂation serve as a motivation to consider some of its (arguably less popular) extensions
or alternatives, such as as big-bounce models [86], cyclic models [87], or string gas cosmology [88]. Most authors,
however, adhere to the paradigm of inﬂationary cosmology, remaining conﬁdent that future work in ﬁeld theory,
string theory, and quantum cosmology [89], in combination with more data, will resolve the outstanding issues. 3.2 Hot thermal phase

Inﬂation ends whenever the equation of state of the inﬂaton ﬁeld (or ﬁelds) no longer supports an accelerating
expansion. ",physics.pop-ph,C,-0.34708714,0.19737051,0.12841986

It is tempting to get bogged down in the microscopic status of a dish’s components when attempting to categorize the

launches from Earth to Solar System and interstellar destinations, while taking into
account the anticipated pace of continued technological progress, was investigated by
previous work [8]. However, as suggested in that study, how far and fast humanity
reaches is a complex function of multiple variables and thus further analysis of imposed
limits is needed for more precise conclusions to be drawn. This study will build upon
the latter by accounting for the economic constraints associated with deep space
exploration. ",physics.pop-ph,C,-0.19382975,-0.53264457,-0.1621494
