show that the same is true for the L-theory of connective ring spectra. It would be interesting
to know whether this is true in full generality, and we plan to come back to this question in
future work. 2. ",math.KT,B_centroid,0.60854775,-0.15124983,-0.37436077

good covers which makes it possible to construct the desired spectral sequences
from a local-to-global principle. This strategy is easily generalizable to construct
local-to-global spectral sequences in other cohomology theories, as we plan to show
in future work [12]. 5.1. ",math.KT,C_centroid,0.06761988,0.5501829,0.23228651

modding out by ùëù or ùë£1. The authors and Mike Hopkins will have more to say about the
prismatic and syntomic cohomologies of ‚Ñì, ku, ko, and MU in future work. We note that the

prismatic cohomologies of E‚àû-ring spectra may be of interest even to those studying prismatic
cohomology of discrete rings. ",math.KT,B,0.25130817,-0.20347391,0.40251815
