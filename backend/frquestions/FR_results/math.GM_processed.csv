ideas is beautifully captured in the work of N. Baas on higher topological structures [Baa16]. Although we postpone discussing any concrete ternary topological structures for future work, we would
like to remark that topology oﬀers a highly developed toolkit of concepts and mathematical theories
that may aid in the systematic investigation of higher arity. Particularly, the theory of simplicial
complexes and topological manifolds [Lee10] provides some useful notions to begin a systematic
enquiry into ternary sequentiality. ",math.GM,C,-0.38949174,-0.3724144,0.71515083

    In order to extend the traditional covering based rough set to the fuzzy environment and give a diﬀerent gener-
alization from [9], we have deﬁned four original overlap function-based fuzzy operators. In addition, we also give
two types of neighborhood-related fuzzy covering-based rough set models which are based on fuzzy neighborhood
operators given in [9] and the new ones deﬁned in the above text. ",math.GM,B,0.09740415,-0.18102929,-0.36172685
