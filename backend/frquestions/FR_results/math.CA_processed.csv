is not possible to provide further analysis based on paper [14] because the polynomial

components of the weight constrain the fulﬁllment of condition (3.4) from the deﬁnition

Recently, Liu and Ren [16] discussed the Pogorelov-type C2 estimates for (k − 1)-convex
and k-convex solutions of the following Sum Hessian equations
