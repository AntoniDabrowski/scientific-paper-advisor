enabling the accommodation of non-ideal response in the material greatly opens up the
candidate possibilities. Consideration of performance in such algorithmic accommodation of
non-idealities needs further examination. Simulations show that the modified algorithm
relaxes the required number of programming steps by one order of magnitude and opens up
the noise tolerance window considerably [57]. ",cs.ET,B,0.11124967,-0.06705001,0.18236643
