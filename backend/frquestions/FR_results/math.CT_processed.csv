the single R-aÔ¨Éne space R generates the SF(V )-ary variety ob(R-AÔ¨Ä) over S, by 10.35. Noting that 10.34 involves closure properties for J -ary varieties over S that are related to
the BirkhoÔ¨Ä variety theorem [5], it is natural to ask whether a generalization of the latter
theorem can be proved in the present general setting, perhaps under additional hypotheses;
we leave this question for future work. References

is to use DeÔ¨Ånition 4.2 as the building block for a more general theory of communication:
intuitively, speakers communicate in a game-theoretic fashion, exchanging explanations and
using them to build meanings until they reach some kind of Ô¨Åxed point, at which providing
further explanations does not result in building further meaning. This broader picture would
fully capture Wittgenstein‚Äôs ideas regarding language games, and we consider it an ambitious

We think the following questions that are interesting for further research:

   1. We learned about factorization of polynomials using two n √ó n matrices (n ‚â• 2), it
       could be interesting to study how polynomials could be factorized using m matrices
       of size n where (n ‚â• 2) and m ‚â• 3. ",math.CT,A,-0.42504656,0.093187414,-0.23999655

                                          it is observed that a further analysis into the category of magmas
                                          is required in attaining a full comprehension on the subject. In-
