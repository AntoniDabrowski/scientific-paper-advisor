Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model we propose has the ability to describe market dynamics
both under the physical measure P and the pricing measure Q. We conclude with a few topics for further research. First, to see if it is possible to
improve the quality of the ﬁts to observed smiles by increasing the number of possible
states (perhaps three). ",q-fin.PR,C,-0.2000522,-0.25274724,0.7013447
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06943v2,Option Pricing with Time-Varying Volatility Risk Aversion,"In this paper, we have introduced time-variation to the pricing kernel, while maintaining
the model with constant parameters under P. So, the time-variation that is introduced in
the pricing kernel get parsed to the model under Q. While this induces time variation in ξ
that governs the variance risk premium, the equity risk parameter, λ, is constant, because it
deﬁned by the model under P. The score-driven approach could be used to introduce time-
variation in λ (and other parameters) but would require a more ﬂexible (and time-varying)

risk model, with a Dirichlet prior, is shown to accommodate several characteristics of risk in the
calculation of aggregate claims, hence yielding robust estimates. In future work, construction of
the non-homogeneous Poisson process could explore, for example, location-speciﬁc factors that can
inﬂuence aggregate claims. There may be speciﬁc geographies that may be more susceptible to
hurricanes, for example. ",q-fin.PR,B_centroid,-0.46047384,0.6947092,-0.05666825

In the present article we have presented a new stochastic local volatility model for the pric-
ing of derivative contracts on commodity futures. Moreover, a calibration methodology is
proposed, which requires the use of hybrid global-local optimization algorithms. ",q-fin.PR,A,0.48704648,-0.042729694,-0.03385658
