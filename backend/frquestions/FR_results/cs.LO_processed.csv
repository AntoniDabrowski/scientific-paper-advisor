7 Related and future work

The main idea behind Prawitz’ ecumenical system [31] is to build a proof framework
in which classical and intuitionistic logics may co-exist in peace. Although one could
argue that this is easily done using the well known double-negation translations by
Kolmogorov, Go¨del, Gentzen and others [11], Prawitz’ view matches the idea presented
by Liang and Miller in their PIL system presented in [19]: not seeing classical logic
as a fragment of intuitionistic logic but rather to determine parts of reasoning which
are classical or intuitionistic in nature. ",cs.LO,C,-0.3029064,0.015201861,-0.06473576

An obvious direction of future work is to add support for increasingly larger subsets of C. Although
the current subset can represent some interesting programs, many other interesting programs cannot be
represented. Work is underway to add support for structures, which are commonly used in C. The main
challenge in supporting additional C features is perhaps the deﬁnition of their representations in the

The original KALM [7, 8, 9] was proposed as a solution to the problem of semantic mismatch in knowl-
edge authoring using natural languages, but this solution was limited to CNLs, which is a severe limita-
tion both in expressiveness and human training. ",cs.LO,C,-0.13579383,0.0777992,-0.22393388
