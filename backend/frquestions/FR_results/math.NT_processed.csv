5 Future Work

We have several ideas for future work:

    • Our primary goal is to parallelize our algorithm from §2 to extend our
       computations. For larger powers, this will also mean using multiple-
       precision integer arithmetic using, for example, GMP. ",math.NT,A,-0.2906903,-0.020526225,-0.35465807
