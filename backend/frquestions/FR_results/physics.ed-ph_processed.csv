Introduction

Scientific initiatives have often proven to be efficient motivators in the realm of education to adequately train
future workforce. Indeed, starting over a decade ago, nanotechnology has demonstrated that the seemingly
disparate disciplines of physics and biology need interfacing. ",physics.ed-ph,A,-0.021322653,-0.13649186,-0.25963438

encompassing solution to these problems. Therefore, a strategy for further research
could be comparative analyses, taking also high-achieving countries in assessments
like PISA and TIMSS into account. But it would also be promising to examine
differences between physics teacher education in Germany and in the U.S. more

We have developed a framework of RBL-STEM learning activities in developing the block
paving tessellation decoration by using the r-dynamic coloring of graphs to improve students'
metaliteracy. This results as an initial activity to carry out further research activities, namely R &
D and experimental research. However, this initial research is not easy, thus joint research for
other STEM cases needs to be explored and as well as the breakthrough for solving the STEM
problems are still widely open. ",physics.ed-ph,A,-0.2608325,-0.1931917,-0.19531766
