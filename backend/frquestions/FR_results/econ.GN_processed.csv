Organizational behavior is a critical component of ﬂexible work. As stated by Brewer and Hensher
(2002), “Individual work arrangements are inﬂuenced by the internal constraints of organisations
such as organisational structure and managerial policies, including human resource management,
work organisation, and external constraints such as union policies and agreements.” The authors
go on to provide an excellent overview of the ways in which organizational behavior aﬀect travel
behavior, and oﬀer a call to action for additional research into the links between the two ﬁelds. Their work builds on previous work by Brewer (1998), who notes that ﬂexible work requires both
willingness and capacity from employers. ",econ.GN,C,-0.08109518,-0.20397826,0.20880213

on linear functional forms in all the models presented in this paper, which likely restricts
the predictive performance of our method. In future work, we hope to extend the model to
accommodate more ﬂexible functional forms (e.g., regression trees). 27We are speciﬁcally referring to total costs, including administrative costs, data collection costs, and the

10 A Network Approach to Consumption

3.2 Individual Perception and Consumption

Generally, positional concerns can be modelled both within an intertemporal
maximisation framework with explicit expectation formation (Drechsel-Grau
& Schmid, 2014) or building merely on current income without any expecta-
tions relating to future income streams (Frank et al., 2014). ",econ.GN,C_centroid,-2.0828098e-05,-0.111227095,0.44966114

toward the cultivation of “big data” sources and the increased adoption of machine
learning methods in economics, we anticipate that the approach in this paper will
have increasing relevance for future work. While our dataset is novel and our estimation methods are built around recent
work in econometrics (Chernozhukov et al., 2017, 2018) and machine learning (Cheng
et al., 2016), the core question we evaluate in this paper has been present in the
economic literature for decades. ",econ.GN,B,0.10045544,0.059916224,-0.078803554

to large changes in MW levels, such as worker mobility and changes in housing supply. Exploring
these issues in the context of a spatial model with worker mobility appears as a fruitful avenue for
future work. 30

inﬁnite deﬂationary spirals, while it yields persistent liquidity traps. These results highlight
how deviations from RE help us understand persistent liquidity traps in theoretical models
and interpret the recent episodes of liquidity traps in Japan, the Euro Area, and the U.S.

    We leave room for future work. In particular, we used the RPE and BRE concepts to
make our point simple and clear, and consequently we abstracted from other self-conﬁrming
equilibria that could emerge under adaptive learning, such as CEE or SCEE. ",econ.GN,B,0.17865619,-0.16451253,0.07194181

Covid-19 mitigation policy on school closures, it leaves open a set of questions about how the
long-term perspective of the aﬀected students will look like. Whether these short-term costs
will translate in long-term lower salaries, as some work predicts, or if any policy actions will
impede the expected growing inequality, is left to future work. 31
