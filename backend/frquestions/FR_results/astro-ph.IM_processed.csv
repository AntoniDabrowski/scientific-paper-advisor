A simple prototype controller was built to prove the ability of the in-house controller to successfully clock the
H2RG detector and acquire and store images as per the requirements of the space-based spectrometer payload. Unfortunately, the ROIC used was old and degraded and is anyway not designed to obtain images since the image

The Geant4 simulation framework is a toolkit library for particle transport codes based on Monte Carlo simula-

the previously validated single Coulomb scattering (SS) model.8 To establish the framework to simulate the
particle scattering, we additionally used version 1.1 of the CADMesh library, which allows us to load triangular
mesh-based CAD ﬁles into Geant4.15 This combination of tools is particularly powerful, as it opens up many
possibilities for future work and exploring the eﬀects of diﬀerent materials and treatments on scattering. The Geant4 set-up is similar to the schematic from the experiment shown in Fig. ",astro-ph.IM,B,-0.053903613,0.063168965,-0.21671595

that the new model derived during commissioning is in excellent shape and within all requirements. 6.1 Maintenance and future work

In a stable orbit and without further vibrations and temperature changes, the model should remain stable
over time. However, this has never been tested and the grating wheel sensor showed a strong dependence on
temperature during ground campaigns and cool-down phase. ",astro-ph.IM,A,0.17344008,0.32826436,0.17968896

and no knowledge of the “correct” parameters of the true signal. Finally, section §5
presents our concluding remarks, describes what we have learned from these tests, and
discusses potential directions for future work. 2. ",astro-ph.IM,B,-0.20271814,0.05514942,0.07590773
