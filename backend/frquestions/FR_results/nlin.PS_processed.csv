including radiation in the analytical calculation. While the inclusion of radiation complicates the calculations, we
believe it is worth investigating in a future work, as this will result in an accurate analytical formula that predicts
the threshold of quantum reﬂection. The above study is fully oriented to the quantum reﬂection, but in general such interactions lead to many other
interesting phenomena such as multi-ejection, snake trapping, and tree-ejection which are possible by controlling the
