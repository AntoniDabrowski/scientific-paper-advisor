http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03462v1,Towards Grassroots Peering at the Edge,"Aside from
technical questions, we see a need for research regarding economics and
incentives for providers to do this, i.e., it is not clear yet if and how ISPs
will beneﬁt from such peering. In this context, sustainability incentives
directed towards infrastructure sharing [23] might play important role,
based on further research on the lifetime environmental impact of edge
hardware [24]. Implications of Multi-Provider Environments on Existing Re-
search: As outlined in our introduction, existing research on fog systems
has so far mostly disregarded the problem of having multiple providers
oﬀer independent edge infrastructure near the edge. ",cs.OH,C,-0.37806678,0.33048928,-0.24657662
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13878v1,Proceedings of the XI International Workshop on Locational Analysis and Related Problems,"Therefore, the information
provided by the new models can be extremely useful to a decision-maker
because together with the location decision, the models directly seek to
ﬁnd structures underlying the problem that can be ”upgraded” in such a
way that a better after-upgrading solution is obtained. Moreover, the re-
search done in this work indicate different directions for future work in
the topic. References

time/position data, the watch can compute relevant parameters such as total time elapsed for the
workout, distance traveled, pace (per mile or kilometer), etc. At the conclusion of a workout, the
user has the opportunity to save the workout data to a file stored on the device; this file can later
be transferred to a computer for further analysis and archival. GPS technology uses a collection of satellites orbiting the earth to triangulate the user’s position
based on the length of time it takes for signals from each satellite to reach the receiver (in this
case, the sports watch) [2]. ",cs.OH,B_centroid,0.5616673,-0.18056877,-0.16591415
