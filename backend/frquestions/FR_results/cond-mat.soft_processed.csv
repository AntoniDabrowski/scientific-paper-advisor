exhibit thermodynamic deviations for relatively large pore size, indicating the more complex
nature of the nanostructure of DESs compared to alcohol solutions. [11, 12] Inspiring future works,

it is noteworthy that, unlike confined organic binary mixtures, [49-52, 64] a direct structural
examination of this phenomenon remains to be established for nanoconfined DESs. Conclusions

  While the effects of confinement on the physical properties of conventional liquids have been
the subject of intense activity over the past two decades, the topic is still in its infancy regarding
emerging new classes of alternative solvents. ",cond-mat.soft,B,0.31118572,-0.307008,-0.012964899
