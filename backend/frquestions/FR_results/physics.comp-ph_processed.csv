to this, we have established some general properties of the nonlinear solutions, which had
not been noticed before: as a matter of fact we prove that the solutions to the nonlinear
eigenvalue equation obey a nonlinear orthogonality condition; additionally we show that
it is possible to obtain new solutions to the nonlinear eigenvalue equation, starting from
a particular solution with n > 1 internal nodes (something that we jokingly refer to as a
""matrioska eﬀect""). The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we derive the nonlinear eigenvalue equation
for the heterogeneous problem and discuss some of its properties; in section 3 we discuss
the conditions of equilibrium and estimate the minimal angular velocity at which a non–
vertical equilibrium can be reached (for a homogeneous string this reduces to the result of
Wilson [1]); in section 4 we prove that the solutions to the nonlinear eigenvalue equation
with more than one node are related to solutions of the nonlinear equation with less nodes
and diﬀerent nonlinear eigenvalues; in section 5 we consider the linearized equation for the
heterogeneous string and derive its solution; in section 6 we have considered a string with
density ρ(s) = γ(1 − s)γ and we have obtained the threshold values for the occurrence of the
nonlinear normal modes using a power series expansion (for the homogeneous case, γ = 1,
our result reproduces the result of Kolodner [4]); ﬁnally in section 7 we state our conclusions

the multigroup (G = 361, M = 16) wall clock reference solution. IV Conclusion and future work

       We have extended a discrete ordinates hybrid method of the time-dependent neutron trans-
port equation to the multigroup setting. The hybrid relies on a splitting of the NTE into collided
and uncollided components and takes advantage of the fact that the collided component can be
accurately approximating using a relatively coarse discretization in angle and energy. ",physics.comp-ph,A,-0.25348398,-0.19004187,-0.060602337
