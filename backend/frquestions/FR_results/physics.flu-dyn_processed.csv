    In this paper, we have proposed an alternate dimensionality reduction proce-
dure based on the fourth order joint moment, i.e., co-kurtosis tensor, as opposed
to co-variance which is the basis for the more commonly used Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA). The rationale for using a higher order joint moment
is that chemical reactions represent stiﬀ dynamics and the chemistry-relevant
samples in a combustion dataset may typically be anomalous (compared to un-
burnt or fully burnt samples). ",physics.flu-dyn,C,0.23103082,-0.33088076,-0.012322767

found that CoK-PCA yields reconstruction errors that are more uniformly distributed across all samples and thus

    The semi-implicit integration scheme for the viscous term in SPH, introduced in [21], has been extended to
support the dummy boundary model, that requires the boundary neighbors viscous velocity to be computed
together with the ﬂuid particles. Due to the diﬀerence in the expressions for the boundary/ﬂuid contribution
versus the ﬂuid/boundary contribution, the resulting coeﬃcient matrix for the implicit system is not strictly
diagonally dominant, but the system is still solvable due to it being weakly-chained diagonally dominant. ",physics.flu-dyn,B,-0.14724864,0.013306901,0.012914926

method where the surface of the particles is well resolved. In future work, we plan to use the same framework
but move from the deterministic setting to study the diﬀusive behaviour in Brownian systems containing
a large particle number. Control of the deterministic error in the multiblob approach, as provided by the
techniques presented in this work, is a necessary piece in understanding also other contributions to the total
error in a dynamic simulation, such as a time-discretisation error and a statistical error in a Brownian setting. ",physics.flu-dyn,C,0.15275088,-0.13558768,0.087012164
