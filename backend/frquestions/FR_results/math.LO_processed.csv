7 Conclusions and future work

The duality in terms of rational polyhedra we presented in this manuscript shows to be fruitful
to study logical properties of the positive fragment of Lukasiewicz logic, in the same fashion as
in the MV-algebraic case. Via this representation, we derived some analogies and diﬀerences
between Lukasiewicz logic and its positive fragment. ",math.LO,B,-0.09232438,0.0066884896,0.032228846

We have taken some ﬁrst steps in the development of the “compatibility frame”
representation of complete lattices from [16, § 2.2]. For future work, among
the most pressing open problems are Question 3.12, Conjecture 3.13, and Ques-
tion A.2. Other natural next steps include moving from representation theo-
rems to categorical dualities and applying our semantics to lattice-based logics. ",math.LO,B,-0.3470323,-0.13015088,0.35364324
