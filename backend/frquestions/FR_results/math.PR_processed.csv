not be zero, but could even be equal one. Thus, condition (4.9) is not only suﬃcient for
concluding µ∗(Adiv) = 0, but also that some condition like (4.9) is necessary to restrict P.

However, we leave the exact characterization of the necessary condition for future work. Proof of Theorem 4.3. ",math.PR,B,0.33038276,0.022487912,-0.03993258

not seem to pose any conceptual diﬃculties; it would be more interesting to explore
this setting in the case of Arithmetic Random Waves, which is known to exhibit
some diﬀerences with respect to Euclidean and Spherical circumstances. We leave
this extension for further research. 1.2 The model

Equation (1.1) shows that waves with random phases can actually be viewed as a su-

perposition of deterministic eigenfunctions centred on random locations {yj}j=1,...,N.
To achieve an analogous construction in the spherical case, we need to recall ﬁrst
that the Laplacian operator in S2 is deﬁned by

Let us mention that the MY property and related characterization triggered a lot of further research developing
in several directions: (1) more general algebraic structures as, a multivariate tree-generated version in Massam
and Wesołowski (2004), matrix variate versions in Letac and Wesołowski (2000), Wesołowski (2002), Massam
and Wesołowski (2006), a combination of the matrix variate and multivariate tree-generated setting in Bobecka
(2015), symmetric cone variate in Kołodziejek (2017), a version in free probability in Szpojankowski (2017);
(2) characterizations based on a weaker assumption of constancy of regressions of moments of T given S
instead of the assumption of independence of S and T - in univariate case in Wesołowski (2002), Chou and
Wang (2004) and in free probability in Szpojankowski (2017) and S´ wieca (2021); (3) a search of more general
maps of the form ψf (a, b) = (f (a + b), f (a) − f (a + b)) and product measures µ ⊗ ν, such that ψf (µ ⊗ ν)
remains a product measure and characterization of respective µ and ν by the independence property in Koudou
and Vallois (2012) with a genuine special case of µ and ν being the Kummer and gamma distributions, see also

to these questions will enable us to have a better understanding of the role played
by the bank and debt. Lastly, we emphasize that econophysics models involving bank and debt have
not received enough attention in the past few years, and the model investigated in
this manuscript can be viewed as the representative of a promising and intriguing
direction for further research in the area of econophysics. For instance, it would be
interesting to introduce a bank in other closely related variants of the basic unbiased
exchange model, such as the so-called poor-biased or rich-biased exchange model
proposed in [2]. ",math.PR,A,-0.22230518,-0.034891665,0.091557235

In this paper we have studied a model of binary opinion dynamics where the agents show a strong form of
bias towards one of the opinions, called the superior opinion. We showed that for complete graphs the model
exhibits rich phase transitions based on the values of the bias parameter and the initial proportion of agents
with the superior opinion. ",math.PR,A,-0.42488825,-0.3205066,-0.0034018531
