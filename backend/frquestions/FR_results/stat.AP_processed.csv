The approach taken in this paper has been very simplistic, only taking into
account the average frequency of the diﬀerent types of vessel arrivals in the
port of Plymouth in each hour and using set proportions of these averages to
predict the potential electricity demand from the charging of the vessels. To
create a more accurate model, further analysis should be done to investigate
how vessel movements could possibly be tied to the weather conditions and
seasonality, for example adopting a similar approach such as the one taken in
[1]. Here machine learning techniques such as clustering could be employed
to identify patterns and seasonal variations in the vessel movement which
would allow for a greater selection of vessel types to be included in the anal-
ysis and therefore producing a more robust prediction of the energy demand. ",stat.AP,A,-0.22851518,-0.0038200393,0.13600692

Running is one of the most popular and practiced sports worldwide, with almost 60 million
people having participated in running, jogging, and trail running in 2017 in the United
States (Statista 2020b). Increasingly more runners use smart watches and devices that
record their workouts, allowing for performance analysis and the planning of future work-
outs. Worldwide smart watch shipments volume as estimated by Statista (2020c) were 74
million units in 2018, 97 million units in 2019, 115 million units in 2020, with an expected
growth to over 258 million units by 2025. ",stat.AP,A,-0.050391827,0.14587727,0.14958233

deﬁne proper prior distributions for Bayesian inference in MFA, and illustrated how the noise level
in collected MFA data may itself be learned from data. Below, we discuss the lessons learned from
the case study on U.S. steel ﬂows, limitations of these approaches, and future work to advance the
Bayesian approach in MFA. 4.1 Using Expert Elicitation in MFA
