  In this paper, we explored both the power of and practical challenges associated with using three hydrogen emission
lines to constrain not just the normalization but also the slope of the dust attenuation law. Using a sample of eleven
galaxies with existing Hα, Hβ, and Paβ measurements, and accounting for observational uncertainties, we showed
that the dust law slope and normalization of one galaxy are well-constrained, an indication of what will be possible in
future work. Eight of the other ten galaxies can be explained using a simple power-law dust attenuation curve given
current observational uncertainties, although some prefer dust law slopes that are signiﬁcantly steeper or shallower

inhomogeneities enhance the along-ﬁeld diffusion we can approximate the lognormal vA,ion distribution as
a Gaussian process. ",astro-ph.GA,A,0.10340846,0.13517286,-0.14319144

     motions

Since we did not apply any initial selection criteria to the stars in the
PM catalogue, it still contains sources that are not associated with the
LMC, but belong to the Milky Way foreground population. For our
further analysis and the calibration of the PMs to an absolute scale,
we cleaned the catalogue and sorted out those sources that are most
likely not related to the LMC. We ﬁrst removed those stars that were
not selected as probable LMC members by Gaia Collaboration et al. ",astro-ph.GA,C,-0.17899193,-0.027064245,0.1219605
