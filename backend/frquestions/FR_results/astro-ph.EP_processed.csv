overturning circulation on water-rich exoplanets might reach the bottom of the ocean and help transport nutrients
back to the thermocline and to the surface, which is beneﬁcial to the biological activity and habitability on water-rich
exoplanets. In this study, the eﬀect of varying wind stresses is tested without considering the full interaction between the
atmosphere and the ocean and the imposed wind stresses are steady, so ocean-atmosphere coupling model can be
utilized to investigate the thermocline depth in future work. The highest vertical diﬀusivity for the interior ocean we
tested is 10−3 m2 s−1 or 100 times that on Earth, which is the estimated strength of vertical mixing on potentially
habitable asynchronous rotating exoplanets around M-dwarfs (Si et al. ",astro-ph.EP,A,-0.26399612,0.25324368,0.14315826
