http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05236v1,Cellular automata that generate symmetrical patterns give singular functions,"From their spatio-
temporal patterns, we obtained the functions fS22 and fS1ˆ26, which equals fS90. In future work, we plan to study the other SPG2dECAs. We will study their
number of nonzero states and their normalized functions. ",nlin.CG,B_centroid,-0.41739878,-0.5861683,7.171184e-08

http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00746v1,Assessing the robustness of critical behavior in stochastic cellular automata,"Because self-organized criticality is possibly one of the main factors for the emergence of intelligence in the human
brain [7], the evaluation of robustness to stochastic variability can be an important measurement for indicating the
presence of intelligence in artiﬁcial systems. In future work, we plan to evaluate the performance of the optimal stochastic CA under perturbations in a machine
learning framework called reservoir computing [27, 28, 29]. Reservoir computing is a biologically-plausible neural
model inspired by the functioning of cortical microcircuits [30]. ",nlin.CG,A_centroid,0.76883024,-0.034516767,-1.8626451e-07
