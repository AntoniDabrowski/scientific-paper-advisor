several simplifying assumptions where made: 1) we studied only the one-stage problem; 2)
we simpliﬁed the drivers’ equilibrium problem into a single welfare optimization problem; 3) we
worked with artiﬁcially generated data; and 4) we assumed that the leader had access to a perfect
forecast of the demand. Motivated by the promising results we obtained here, we aim to improve
all these aspects in a future work. Acknowledgements: This work was partially supported by Centro de Modelamiento Matema´tico

To conclude what we said above:

    • The space V, which contains the sweeping process we constructed, has a clear physical
       interpretation and its dimension depends on the structural properties of the lattice and the
       enforced boundary conditions (LSM2). • It is convenient to require (by condition (15)) the boundary condition to be tight enough
       for the lattice to be kinematically determinate for the following reasons:

          – every stress load is resolvable, so there is no need for a condition on allowed stress
              load (apart from the safe load condition (35), which comes from the limitations of
              perfect plasticity),

          – there is an explicit formula for the dimension of the sweeping process (Proposition
              B.1) and for matrix H in (LSM6) (last equality in (22)),

          – it corresponds to the physically correct situation is a real experiment when a specimen
              is properly secuired with no freely moving part,

          – while it is beyond the scope of the current paper, in a kinematically determinate lattice
              we can compute the displaced positions of the nodes from knowing elastic and plastic
              elongations, which can be the used in further research. • Condition (16) excludes the case of a statically determinate lattice which leads to a degen-
       erate sweeping process. ",math.OC,B,-0.20318246,0.1073235,-0.14822686
