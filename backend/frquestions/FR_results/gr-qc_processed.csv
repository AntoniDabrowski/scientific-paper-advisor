Using the Kanatchikov’s algorithm for the treatment of constraints within the covariant
De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formulation we have constracted the DW Hamiltonian
density of the Palatini formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity on

                                              7
the reduced polymomentum phase space and formulated the covariant DW Hamilton-
Jacobi equation which is deﬁned on the conﬁguration space of vielbein variables and
space-time variable. The problems to be considered in future work is a generalization
of our consideration to non-Einsteinian teleparallel gravity theories and the study of
the relation of our covariant Hamilton-Jacobi formulation with the standard Hamilton-
Jacobi formulation based on 3+1 decomposition which is not yet formulated within
the canonical Hamiltonian formalism for teleparallel gravities. It is also interesting to
investigate if the DW Hamilton-Jacobi equation we have derived can be obtained in the
quasiclassical limit of the precanonical quantization of TEGR described in [59,60]. ",gr-qc,C,-0.23659311,-0.09006202,-0.19860296

   The number of observed GW signals steadily increased in the past years
up to 46 conﬁrmed detections of BBHs, and it is expected to rise even more
in the next decade, as consequence of the upgrades in the GW detectors. Consequently, waveform models have to be not only accurate, but also fast
to analyze the increasing number of detected signals on reasonable timescales. ",gr-qc,B,0.5240305,0.25337818,0.091735974
