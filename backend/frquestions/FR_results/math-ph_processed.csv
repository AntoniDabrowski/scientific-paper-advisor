a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds relative to a contact structure. In
particular, we have studied families of conservative contact Lie systems. ",math-ph,A,0.06260636,-0.3897792,-0.24701884

Figure 4: The oﬀ-diagonal correlation coeﬃcient gn,k, calculated from the gap Chern

number distributions of all random matrix sizes and matrix-element correlations in

the short correlations regime ρσ ≥ 0.7, and all base levels n, shown as a function of

the oﬀset k. The centres and error bars of each point show the mean and standard

deviation (respectively) of the population of gn,k samples obtained in this way; the

smallness of the standard deviations supports the hypothesis that the gn,k are uni-

versal coeﬃcients independent of n. The universal function is well described by the

small, the deviations from (15) and (16) are quite signiﬁcant. This may be an indication that
there are non-trivial multi-level correlations between Chern numbers, but further study of
this question is beyond the present scope. 7 Conclusions

The present numerical study of the Chern numbers of parametric random matrix models
examined three types of statistics: moments of the single-band Chern number distribution,
correlations of the gap Chern numbers, and the variance of weighted sums of band Chern
numbers. ",math-ph,B,-0.06672037,0.21714996,0.1639401
