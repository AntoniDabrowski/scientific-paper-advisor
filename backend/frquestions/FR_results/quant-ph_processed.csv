circuits, and single-photon detectors, in which the main sources of noise are photon loss

    We implemented a general recursive quantum error correction scheme for fully-correlated channels on n-qubits
with error operators of the form W ⊗n using diﬀerent IBM quantum computers. The scheme was proposed in earlier
papers, where an erroneous decomposition of the encoding operator was given for the 3-qubit channels. ",quant-ph,C,0.4003741,0.11562477,-0.010076486
