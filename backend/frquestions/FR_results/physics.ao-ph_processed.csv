the variance partitioning but the effect are non-systematic. This suggests that further analysis would be required to make any
conclusive statements. We did not perform the QDM globally, because the algorithm is quite computationally expensive. ",physics.ao-ph,A,-0.02422269,0.31088227,0.09344889

temperature and salinity along the sloping continental boundaries around the Atlantic and
Antarctic continent, using a boundary mapping algorithm. This chapter summarises the Ô¨Åndings of the thesis in a broader oceanographic context,
and outlines opportunities for further study. Due to the increasing prevalence of models with
1/4‚ó¶ spatial resolution within the latest GCMs, we draw conclusions for the HadGEM-GC3.1
1/4‚ó¶ model in particular from across the thesis. ",physics.ao-ph,B,0.039758977,-0.07111423,0.041278526

sities did not converge until ‚àÜV24 was above the 97th percentile (approximately 40 kt/24h). This discrepancy partially justiÔ¨Åes the need for further examination of the statistical RI
thresholds. IntensiÔ¨Åcation is likely strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by initial state of the vortex, which are
reÔ¨Çected in part by the initial intensity and size. ",physics.ao-ph,C,0.2308352,0.058974765,-0.014435952
