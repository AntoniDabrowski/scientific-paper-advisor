This section ﬁrst connects the recent invariants of more general periodic point
sets with complete invariants of lattices. Then we discuss linear operations, scalar
products, CAT(0) property of LIS(R2) and ﬁnally describe future work. Below we prove that other continuous isometry invariants AMD (average min-
imum distances) and PDD (pointwise distance distribution) are complete for lat-
tices, though they make sense for general periodic and ﬁnite point sets [27, 28]. ",math.MG,C,-0.39761907,-0.51330876,-0.14664401
