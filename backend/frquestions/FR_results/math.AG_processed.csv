locus is reduced near X and rPvpqqpXqsred ‰ 0, then Proposition 5.5 proves
smoothness near X since the dimension of the tangent space is constant near
X. We hope to pursue this direction in a future work. Appendix A. ",math.AG,B,-0.18873659,-0.0633172,-0.3199203

of dual constructible DP† Q-modules (at least for objects of Frobenius type), as was predicted by Le
Stum. We intend to return to this question in future work. By embedding a k-variety inside a smooth and proper formal V-scheme, this gives rise to a

algebra of the abelian variety. A further study of index and generic vanishing theory of simple semiho-
mogeneous bundles was also carried out in [Gri21] building on and reﬁning [Gri14a], [Gri14b]. Beside the notion of GV sheaves, a related notion in the generic vanishing theory is that of M–regularity

we elucidate much of the structure of the Jacobian of Bring’s curve, giving new derivations
of previously known results, and identifying new quotients of the curve. In doing so, we also
discover isomorphisms (as opposed to isogenies) of quotients not explained by group theory
alone, and these deserve further study. In §5 we will develop the understanding of the theta
characteristics on the curve, including explicitly the unique invariant one. ",math.AG,C,-0.0655511,-0.13826334,0.388856
http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.14351v1,Perverse sheaves on symmetric products of the plane,"One
could alternatively deduce our theorem using Nakajima’s work instead, however the oper-
ators he studies do not generate the algebra over the integers and so more care is needed to
keep track of denominators. Another possible approach to our main results, which we hope to explore in future work,
would be to use the work of Bezrukavnikov–Kaledin [BK04] or Bridgeland–King–Reid and
Haiman [BKR01, Hai01], which gives an isomorphism between the K-theory of Hilbn(C2)
and the Sn-equivariant K-theory of (C2)n. Using this isomorphism, the top Borel-Moore
homology of the Ginzburg convolution variety inside Hilbn(C2)× Hilbn(C2) should be iden-
tiﬁed with a piece of the (Sn × Sn)-equivariant K-theory of the union of graphs of elements
of Sn acting on (C2)n. We expect that this approach will provide a more conceptual expla-
nation for the appearance of equivariant sheaves on Sn in our result. Acknowledgements. ",math.AG,B_centroid,-0.13773002,0.08741146,0.069918364
