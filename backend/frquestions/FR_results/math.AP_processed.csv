   The dissipation estimate (1.6), together with further analysis on the degeneracy part
through the standard micro-macro decomposition, provides the following full coercivity de-
pending on the interchange rates:

       L(∂α(f1, f2)), ∂α(f1, f2) L2 ≤ −η min {(1 − δ), (1 − ω)}                        (∂α(f1, f2)   2       . x,v                       L2

Due to the presence of the momentum interchange rate δ and the energy interchange rate ω
between diﬀerent components in the dissipation estimate, we see that the larger interchange
rate (when δ and ω are close to zero) leads to the stronger dissipation, and therefore, the
faster convergence to the global equilibrium:

operator depending on W and V. If one considers W and V as probability distribution
functions, the case we considered means that we assumed the jointly distribution to the
product (which would mean they are the distribution of independent random variables). We can also have the following question

    “Is it possible consider generalized second order operators by considering formal
derivatives with respect an Borel measure on Td not necessarily given by the product

Finally, turning our attention to the W -Brownian motion BW , and pointing that, the
jumps of BW is subordinated to the jumps of W and expecting that this model of
stochastic process can be useful in future works related to stocks in the ﬁnancial market
one nice question about future models related to this object is
“By embedding BW on a random environment, in such a manner that the functions V

    and W are random, thus making the jump sites random, is there a choice of the
random environment such that the (unconditional) ﬁnite dimensional distributions of

                                        BW are still Gaussian?”
