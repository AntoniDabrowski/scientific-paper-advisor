    It turned out that for low-mass black holes the slope of the regression is much
smaller than for the sample of supermassive black holes. It could be caused by
a change in the geometry of the region of X-ray radiation - this and other
possible hypotheses requires further research. However, it is already clear that
these correlations are extremely useful - it can be used to estimate the X-ray
luminosity for calculating the exposures necessary to accumulate a suﬃcient
number of photons for spectral analysis. ",astro-ph.HE,A,-0.32885605,-0.122221544,0.035541035
