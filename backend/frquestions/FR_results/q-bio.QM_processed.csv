platforms provide detailed and standardized meta-data that can be accessed programmatically
and easily used in high throughput computational analyses.121 An alternative approach is to
verify the strain annotation using taxonomy assignments provided in the SRA Run Browser
analysis tab, or to perform assignment using with a tool like sourmash gather, which selects the
minimum set of reference genomes in a database necessary to cover the reads in a sample.122

Alternatively, a pangenome could be used as a reference so that core genes are collapsed
across strain types while accessory genes are included in the analysis.109 Using these
pangenomes as a reference balances computational cost and fidelity to sample genomes, and
can take advantage of databases designed to address similar problems for metagenomic
sample processing.123 This approach was pioneered for the analysis of Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus) strains directly from metatranscriptomes, as no reference genome was available
with which to perform read quantification. This approach may be successful for building species-
wide compendia but needs further research. Indeed, one substantial draw back would be the
negation of spanning reads, as pangenomes are typically built from genes and not operons. ",q-bio.QM,B,0.20758787,0.29508442,0.044637747

           observed correlations that are consistent with existing knowledge;

classiﬁcation on Protein Data Bank Data and shown that deep learning models, in particular convolutional neural
networks, are superior over classical machine learning techniques due to their added complexity and ability to understand
sequential information on PDB data. Despite the power of these models, constraints of interpretability leave much to be
desired in the way of meaningful classiﬁcations, a possible direction for future work. 11
