many heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such
as consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are
common economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and
outcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational
methods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and
interact, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a
key reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward
function of another agent, e.g., a consumer's expendable income changes when
firms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash
equilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many
agents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only
simulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does
not need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used
for analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and
analyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time
frames, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in
real-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100
worker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We
validate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate
best-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions,
and that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum
of meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.",-0.28814945,0.467338,-0.22844863,B

various outcome relations, including a qualitative variant of ex-post

incentive compatibility for agents without contingent reasoning skills:
obviously strategyproof mechanisms guarantee that it is ""obvious"" for these
imperfectly rational agents to behave honestly, whereas non-obviously
manipulable (NOM) mechanisms take a more optimistic view and ensure that these
agents will only misbehave when it is ""obvious"" for them to do so. Technically,
obviousness requires comparing certain extrema (defined over the actions of the
other agents) of an agent's utilities for honest behaviour against dishonest
behaviour.
  We present a technique for designing NOM mechanisms in settings where
monetary transfers are allowed based on cycle monotonicity, which allows us to
disentangle the specification of the mechanism's allocation from the payments.
By leveraging this framework, we completely characterise both allocation and
payment functions of NOM mechanisms for single-parameter agents. We then look
at the classical setting of bilateral trade and study whether and how much
subsidy is needed to guarantee NOM, efficiency, and individual rationality. We
prove a stark dichotomy; no finite subsidy suffices if agents look only at
best-case extremes, whereas no subsidy at all is required when agents focus on
worst-case extremes. We conclude the paper by characterising the NOM mechanisms
that require no subsidies whilst satisfying individual rationality.",0.032467455,-0.18521371,0.067207746,C

a service to a group of potential buyers. Each buyer $i$ has a private value
$v_i$ for receiving the service and a feasibility constraint restricts which
sets of buyers can be served simultaneously. Recent work in economics
introduced clock auctions as a superior class of auctions for this problem, due
to their transparency, simplicity, and strong incentive guarantees. Subsequent
work focused on evaluating the social welfare approximation guarantees of these
auctions, leading to strong impossibility results: in the absence of prior
information regarding the buyers' values, no deterministic clock auction can
achieve a bounded approximation, even for simple feasibility constraints with
only two maximal feasible sets.
  We show that these negative results can be circumvented by using prior
information or by leveraging randomization. We provide clock auctions that give
a $O(\log\log k)$ approximation for general downward-closed feasibility
constraints with $k$ maximal feasible sets for three different information
models, ranging from full access to the value distributions to complete absence
of information. The more information the seller has, the simpler these auctions
are. Under full access, we use a particularly simple deterministic clock
auction, called a single-price clock auction, which is only slightly more
complex than posted price mechanisms. In this auction, each buyer is offered a
single price and a feasible set is selected among those who accept their
offers. In the other extreme, where no prior information is available, this
approximation guarantee is obtained using a complex randomized clock auction.
In addition to our main results, we propose a parameterization that
interpolates between single-price clock auctions and general clock auctions,

successfully find a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch (VM) --
which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits
-- a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit's
volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform's
recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this
external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the
goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform's problem as a
special case of online matching, where (using VM terminology) volunteers arrive
sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which
has finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is
interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic
may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform's online algorithm
selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating different algorithms, we
parameterize the competitive ratio based on the amount of external traffic.
After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly-used algorithm that is
optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm --
Adaptive Capacity (AC) -- which accounts for matches differently based on
whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower
bound on AC's competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external
traffic and that is close to the parameterized upper bound we establish on the
competitive ratio of any online algorithm. Our analysis utilizes a path-based,
pseudo-rewards approach, which we further generalize to settings where the
platform can recommend a ranked set of opportunities. Beyond our theoretical

access is detected. Defenders can audit alerts to reduce potential damage. This
interaction process between a defender and an attacker can be modeled as an
audit game. In previous studies, it was found that sending real-time signals in

However, the previous approaches usually assume perfect information of the

either invest in a public project or decide not to invest. Based on the

altruism, which players often exhibit and can significantly affect equilibrium
behavior. Yu et al. [24] extended the classical BNPG game to capture the
altruistic aspect of the players. We, in this paper, first study the problem of
deciding the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) in a BNPG
game with altruism. This problem is already known to be NP-complete. We
complement this hardness result by showing that the problem admits efficient
algorithms when the input network is either a tree or a complete graph. We
further study the Altruistic Network Modification problem, where the task is to
compute if a target strategy profile can be made a PSNE by adding or deleting a

surprising finding of our work is that the above problem remains NP-hard even
for bounded degree graphs when the altruism network is undirected, but becomes
polynomial-time solvable when the altruism network is directed. We also show

tight performance ratios between online and offline allocation algorithms.
Typically, tightness is established by constructing an algorithmic guarantee
and a worst-case instance separately, whose bounds match as a result of some
""ingenuity"". In this paper, we instead formulate the construction of the
worst-case instance as an optimization problem, which directly finds the tight
ratio without needing to construct two bounds separately.
  Our analysis of this complex optimization problem involves identifying
structure in a new ""Type Coverage"" dual problem. It can be seen as akin to the
celebrated Magician and OCRS (Online Contention Resolution Scheme) problems,
except more general in that it can also provide tight ratios relative to the
optimal offline allocation, whereas the earlier problems only establish tight
ratios relative to the ex-ante relaxation of the offline problem.
  Through this analysis, our paper provides a unified framework that derives
new results and recovers many existing ones. First, we show that the
""oblivious"" method of setting a static threshold due to Chawla et al. (2020)
is, surprisingly, best-possible among all static threshold algorithms, for any
number $k$ of starting units. We emphasize that this result is derived without
needing to explicitly find any counterexample instances. We establish similar
""no separation"" results for static thresholds in the IID setting, which
although previously known, required the construction of complicated

where $A\succ B\succ C$ is identified with both $B\succ C\succ A$ and $C\succ

the question of what sort of ballots may be appropriate; a single cyclic order,

the group of permutations on the set of agents. A reasonable requirement for a
choice procedure would be to respect this symmetry (the equivalent of
neutrality in normal voting theory).

table, perhaps for a game of chance or for dinner. Given a set of agents such
as $\{A,B,C\}$, we can formalize this by defining a cyclic order as a
permutation or linear order on this finite set, under the equivalence relation
where $A\succ B\succ C$ is identified with both $B\succ C\succ A$ and $C\succ
A\succ B$. As with other collections of sets with some structure, we might want
to aggregate preferences of a (possibly different) set of voters on the set of
possible ways to choose a cyclic order.
  However, given the combinatorial explosion of the number of full rankings of
cyclic orders, one may not wish to use the usual voting machinery. This raises
the question of what sort of ballots may be appropriate; a single cyclic order,
a set of them, or some other ballot type? Further, there is a natural action of
the group of permutations on the set of agents. A reasonable requirement for a
choice procedure would be to respect this symmetry (the equivalent of
neutrality in normal voting theory).
  In this paper we will exploit the representation theory of the symmetric
group to analyze several natural types of ballots for voting on cyclic orders,
and points-based procedures using such ballots. We provide a full
characterization of such procedures for two quite different ballot types for
$n=4$, along with the most important observations for $n=5$.",-0.08771701,0.23729075,0.06270025,C

However,
sometimes a committee is highly structured, and if we want to vote for such a
committee, our voting method should be more structured as well. We consider
committees consisting of representatives for disjoint parts of a collective;
for instance, n departments of an organization might each have m possible
representatives to choose from. However, in our model the entire population
still gets to vote on the committee, and we need to respect that symmetry,
which we do by building on earlier work of Barcelo et al. using representation
theory of wreath products. The main thrust of this paper is to advertise and
catalog the surprising variety of possible points-based (linear) voting methods
in this framework. For instance, if a voter ranks all possible structured
committees, it may be reasonable to use weights which depend on the relations
between the ranked committees, and not just their order as in 'traditional'
voting frameworks!",-0.176563,0.14875281,-0.026193555,B

realized in the framework of hedonic games, which originate from economic
theory. The main focus of this branch of research has been on the existence and
the computational complexity of deciding the existence of coalition structures
that satisfy various stability criteria. The actual process of forming
coalitions based on individual behavior has received little attention. In this
paper, we study the convergence of simple dynamics leading to stable partitions
in a variety of established classes of hedonic games including anonymous,
dichotomous, fractional, and hedonic diversity games. The dynamics we consider
is based on individual stability: an agent will join another coalition if she
is better off and no member of the welcoming coalition is worse off.
  Our results are threefold. First, we identify conditions for the (fast)
convergence of our dynamics. To this end, we develop new techniques based on
the simultaneous usage of multiple intertwined potential functions and
establish a reduction uncovering a close relationship between anonymous hedonic
games and hedonic diversity games. Second, we provide elaborate counterexamples
determining tight boundaries for the existence of individually stable
partitions. Third, we study the computational complexity of problems related to
the coalition formation dynamics. In particular, we settle open problems
suggested by Bogomolnaia and Jackson (2002), Brandl et al. (2005), and Boehmer
and Elkind (2020).",-0.11487954,-0.3545655,-0.26954523,C
