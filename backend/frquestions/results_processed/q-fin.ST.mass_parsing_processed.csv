volatility evolution of stock market index after extreme events, and find that
the volatility after extreme events follows a stretched exponential decay in
the initial stage and becomes a power law decay at later times by using high
frequency minute data. Empirical study of the evolutionary behaviors of
volatility after endogenous and exogenous events further demonstrates the
descriptive power of our new model. To further explore the underlying
mechanisms of volatility evolution, we introduce the sequential arrival of
information hypothesis (SAIH) and the mixture of distribution hypothesis (MDH)
to test the two-stage assumption, and find that investors transform from the
uninformed state to the informed state in the first stage and informed
investors subsequently dominate in the second stage. The testing results offer
a supporting explanation for the validity of our new model and the fitted

verified and validated by using the extreme value statistics in random matrix
theory. We find that the random evolution of each pair of stocks in a 2D price
space is a scale-invariant complex trajectory whose tortuosity is governed by a
$2/3$ geometric law between the gyration radius $R_g(t)$ and the total length
$\ell(t)$ of the path, i.e., $R_g(t)\sim\ell(t)^{2/3}$. We construct a Wishart
matrix containing all stocks up to a specific variable period and look at its
spectral properties over 30 years. In contrast to the standard random matrix
theory, we find that the distribution of eigenvalues has a power-law tail with
a decreasing exponent over time -- a quantitative indicator of the temporal
correlations. We find that the time evolution of the distance of a 2D L\'evy

of Transfer Entropy is not known for finite-size samples, statistical testing
is often performed with bootstraps whose slowness prevents the inference of
large lead-lag networks between long time series. On the other hand, the
asymptotic distribution of Transfer Entropy between two time series is known.
In this work, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test for one time
series having a larger Transfer Entropy than another one on a target time
series. We then measure the convergence speed of both tests in the small sample
size limits via benchmarks. We then introduce Transfer Entropy between
time-shifted time series, which allows to measure the timescale at which
information transfer is maximal and vanishes. We finally apply these methods to

Bitcoin using a feedforward neural network. Due to the increasing popularity of
cryptocurrencies in recent years, the question has arisen, as to whether market
inefficiencies could be exploited in Bitcoin. Several studies we refer to here
discuss this topic in the context of Bitcoin using either statistical tests or
machine learning methods, mostly relying exclusively on data from Bitcoin
itself. Results regarding market efficiency vary from study to study. In this
study, however, the focus is on applying various asset-related input features
in a neural network. The aim is to investigate whether the prediction accuracy
improves when adding equity stock indices (S&P 500, Russell 2000), currencies
(EURUSD), 10 Year US Treasury Note Yield as well as Gold&Silver producers index
(XAU), in addition to using Bitcoin returns as input feature. As expected, the
results show that more features lead to higher training performance from 54.6%
prediction accuracy with one feature to 61% with six features. On the test set,
we observe that with our neural network methodology, adding additional asset
classes, no increase in prediction accuracy is achieved. One feature set is
able to partially outperform a buy-and-hold strategy, but the performance drops
again as soon as another feature is added. This leads us to the partial
conclusion that weak market inefficiencies for Bitcoin cannot be detected using
neural networks and the given asset classes as input. Therefore, based on this
study, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is efficient in the sense of
the efficient market hypothesis during the sample period. We encourage further
research in this area, as much depends on the sample period chosen, the input
features, the model architecture, and the hyperparameters.",-0.26403543,-0.17720224,0.099833325,C

find that default risk conditional on survival converges for borrowers in
disparate credit risk bands well before scheduled termination, a phenomenon we
call credit risk convergence. We then use actuarial techniques to derive the

current deep subprime and subprime borrowers eventually overpay by annual

for balancing forecast errors due to the rising volumes of intermittent
renewable generation. However, compared to day-ahead markets, the drivers for
the intraday price process are still sparsely researched. In this paper, we
propose a modelling strategy for the location, shape and scale parameters of
the return distribution in intraday markets, based on fundamental variables. We
consider wind and solar forecasts and their intraday updates, outages, price
information and a novel measure for the shape of the merit-order, derived from
spot auction curves as explanatory variables. We validate our modelling by
simulating price paths and compare the probabilistic forecasting performance of
our model to benchmark models in a forecasting study for the German market. The
approach yields significant improvements in the forecasting performance,
especially in the tails of the distribution. At the same time, we are able to
derive the contribution of the driving variables. We find that, apart from the
first lag of the price changes, none of our fundamental variables have
explanatory power for the expected value of the intraday returns. This implies
weak-form market efficiency as renewable forecast changes and outage
information seems to be priced in by the market. We find that the volatility is
driven by the merit-order regime, the time to delivery and the closure of
cross-border order books. The tail of the distribution is mainly influenced by
past price differences and trading activity. Our approach is directly
transferable to other continuous intraday markets in Europe.",-0.25545877,-0.33120054,-0.31751817,B

An
emerging approach in this domain is to use graphical modeling and analysis to
for prediction of next market index fluctuations. One important question in
this domain is how to construct an appropriate graphical model of the data that
can be effectively used by a semi-supervised GNN to predict index fluctuations.
In this paper, we introduce a framework called NETpred that generates a novel
heterogeneous graph representing multiple related indices and their stocks by
using several stock-stock and stock-index relation measures. It then thoroughly
selects a diverse set of representative nodes that cover different parts of the
state space and whose price movements are accurately predictable. By assigning
initial predicted labels to such a set of nodes, NETpred makes sure that the
subsequent GCN model can be successfully trained using a semi-supervised
learning process. The resulting model is then used to predict the stock labels
which are finally aggregated to infer the labels for all the index nodes in the
graph. Our comprehensive set of experiments shows that NETpred improves the
performance of the state-of-the-art baselines by 3%-5% in terms of F-score
measure on different well-known data sets.",-0.15535769,0.20761922,-0.44866318,C
