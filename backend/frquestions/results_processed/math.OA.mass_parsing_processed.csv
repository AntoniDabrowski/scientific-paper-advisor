Quantum graphs are realised principally as either certain operators on

show that each such ""non-tracial"" quantum graphs corresponds to a ""tracial""

homomorphisms (or CP-morphisms) of quantum graphs arising from UCP maps, and
the closely related examples of quantum graphs constructed from UCP maps. We
show that these constructions satisfy automatic bimodule properties. We study
quantum automorphisms of quantum graphs, give a definition of what it means for

unitary fusion categories. We prove the complete positivity of the
comultiplication for subfactors and derive a primary $n$-criterion of unitary
categorifcation of multifusion rings. It is stronger than the Schur product
criterion when $n\geq3$. The primary criterion could be transformed into
various criteria which are easier to check in practice even for noncommutative,
high-rank, high-multiplicity, multifusion rings. More importantly, the primary
criterion could be localized on a sparse set, so that it works for multifusion
rings with sparse known data. We give numerous examples to illustrate the
efficiency and the power of these criteria.",-0.048496377,-0.005762985,-0.0401446,B

odd spectral triples on noncommutative solenoids can be considered as direct
limits of spectral triples on rotation algebras. In the final section we prove
a noncommutative Wiener's lemma and show that our odd spectral triples can be
defined to have an associated smooth dense subalgebra which is stable under the
holomorphic functional calculus, thus answering a question of B. Long and W.
Wu. The construction of the smooth subalgebra also extends to the case of
nilpotent discrete groups.",-0.1150481,-0.1665938,0.14728622,B
