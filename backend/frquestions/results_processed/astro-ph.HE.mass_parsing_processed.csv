remains an open question. Galactic CRs with energy up to the knee ($10^{15}$
eV) are considered to originate from supernova remnants, but this scenario has
recently been questioned due to lack of TeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts in many
cases. Extragalactic CRs on the other hand, are thought to be associated with
accelerated particles in the relativistic jets launched by supermassive
accreting black holes at the center of galaxies. Scaled down versions of such
jets have been detected in X-ray binaries hosting a stellar black hole (BHXBs).
In this work, we investigate the possibility that the smaller-scale jets in
transient outbursts of low-mass BHXBs could be sources of Galactic CRs. To
better test this scenario, we model the entire electromagnetic spectrum of such
sources focusing on the potential TeV regime, using the `canonical' low-mass
BHXB GX 339-4 as a benchmark. Taking into account both the leptonic radiative
processes and the $\gamma$-rays produced via neutral pion decay from inelastic
hadronic interactions, we predict the GeV and TeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum of GX
339-4 using lower-frequency emission as constraints. Based on this test-case of
GX 339-4 we investigate whether other, nearby low-mass BHXBs could be detected
by the next-generation very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray facility the Cherenkov
Telescope Array, which would establish them as additional and numerous

supernovae (SNe) collected from the literature and observed with the Subaru

width of [O I] are employed to infer the ejecta geometry and the expansion
velocity of the inner core. These two measurements are then compared with the
SN sub types, and further with the [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, which is used as an
indicator of the progenitor CO core mass. Based on the best fit results of the
[O I] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups,
and we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature
for all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at about 1 sigma level) that the
distributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical
SESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O I] width and [O I]/[Ca
II] ratio is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to
expand faster for objects with a more massive CO core. Such a correlation can
be utilized to constrain the relation between the progenitor mass and the
kinetic energy of the explosion. Further, when [O I]/[Ca II] ratio increases,
the fraction of objects with Gaussian [O I] profile increases, while those with
double-peaked profile decreases. This phenomenon connects ejecta geometry and

still unclear. Recent theoretical and observational developments have led to
renewed interest in double degenerate models, in particular the ""helium-ignited

carry it into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase up to 4000 years after the
explosion, past the time when all the ejecta have been shocked. Assuming a
uniform ambient medium, we reveal specific signatures of the explosion
mechanism and spatial variations intrinsic to the ejecta. The first detonation
produces an ejecta tail visible at early times, while the second detonation
leaves a central density peak in the ejecta that is visible at late times. The
SNR shell is off-centre at all times, because of an initial velocity shift due
to binary motion. The companion WD produces a large conical shadow in the
ejecta, visible in projection as a dark patch surrounded by a bright ring. This
is a clear and long-lasting feature that is localized, and its impact on the
observed morphology is dependent on the viewing angle of the SNR. These results

neutron stars (HMNS). We generate constant rest mass sequences of
differentially rotating and uniformly rotating stars. The nucleonic matter
relevant to the star interior is described within the framework of the
relativistic mean field model with the DD2 parameter set. We also consider the
strange $\Lambda$ hyperons using the BHB$\Lambda\phi$ equation of state (EoS).
Additionally, we probe the behaviour of neutron stars (NS) with these
compositions at different temperatures. We report that the addition of hyperons
to the EoS produces a significant boost to the spin-up phenomenon. Moreover,
increasing the temperature can make the spin-up more robust. We also study the
impact of strangeness and thermal effects on the T/W instability. Finally, we
analyse equilibrium sequences of a NS following a stable transition from
differential rotation to uniform rotation. The decrease in frequency relative

density spectrum. A high-frequency QPO (HFQPO) at 67 Hz has been observed in
this source, albeit less often than the type-C QPOs. Besides these features,
GRS 1915+105 sometimes shows a broad bump in the power spectrum at around
30-150 Hz. We study the power spectra of GRS 1915+105 with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer when the source was in the $\chi$ class. We find that the rms
amplitude of the bump depends strongly upon both the frequency of the type-C
QPO and the hardness ratio, and is correlated with the corona temperature and
anti-correlated with the radio flux at 15 GHz. The characteristic frequency of
the bump is better correlated with a combination of the frequency of the type-C
QPO and the hardness ratio than with the frequency of the type-C QPO alone. The
rms amplitude of the bump generally increases with energy from ~1-2% at ~3 keV
to ~10-15% at ~30 keV. We suggest that the bump and the high-frequency QPO may
be the same variability component but the properties of the corona affect the
coherence of this variability, leading either to a HFQPO when the spectrum is
in the relatively soft $\gamma$ class, or to a bump when the spectrum is in the
hard $\chi$ class. Finally, we discuss the anti-correlation between the rms
amplitude of the bump and the radio flux in the context of the relation between

scenario for type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) the merger process of the core of the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and the white dwarf (WD) maintains an
envelope mass of ~0.03Mo that causes a later helium shell flash. I estimate the
number of pre-explosion helium shell flash events to be less than few per cents
of all CD scenario SNe Ia. A helium shell flash while the star moves to the
left on the HR diagram as a post-AGB star (late thermal pulse; LTP) or along
the WD cooling track (very LTP) causes the star to expand and become a born
again AGB star. Merger remnants exploding while still on the AGB form
{hydrogen-polluted} peculiar SNe Ia, while an explosion inside an inflated
born-again star results in an early flux excess in the light curve of the SN
Ia. The fraction of systems that might show an early flux excess due to
LTP/VLTP is <(few)x10^{-4} of all SNe Ia, much below the observed fraction. In
the frame of the CD scenario SNe Ia with early flux excess result from SN
ejecta collision with planetary nebula fallback gas, or from mixing of 56Ni to
the outer regions of the SN ejecta. Ongoing sky surveys might find about one

echoes with similar delays and it may actually power the diﬀuse neutrino ﬂux at the highest energies, at the expense
of very high proton and neutrino energies.","Since our models predicts a neutrino luminosity roughly scaling Lν ∝ M 2 (except for M-X, where it could be

multi-messenger follow-ups. In all cases, the neutrino observation occurred
O(100) days after the maximum of the optical-ultraviolet (OUV) luminosity. We
discuss unified fully time-dependent interpretations of these events, where the
neutrino delays are not a statistical effect, but rather the consequence of a
physical scale of the post-disruption system. Noting that X-rays and infrared
(IR) dust echoes have been observed in all cases, we consider three models in
which quasi-isotropic neutrino emission is due to the interactions of
accelerated protons of moderate, medium, and high energy energies with X-rays,
OUV, and IR photons, respectively. We find that the neutrino time delays can be
well described in the X-ray model assuming magnetic confinement of protons in a
calorimetric approach, and in the IR model, where the delay is directly
correlated with the time evolution of the echo luminosity (for which a model is
developed here). The OUV model exhibits the highest neutrino production
efficiency. In all three models, the highest neutrino fluence is predicted for
AT2019aalc, due to its high estimated SMBH mass and low redshift. All models

galactic feedback. Only in nearby galaxies could we have high enough angular
resolution in multi-wavelengths to study the sub-kpc environment of the AGN,
where the bubbles are produced and strongly interact with the surrounding ISM.
In this paper, we present the latest Chandra observations of the Virgo cluster
galaxy NGC 4438, which hosts multi-scale bubbles detected in various bands. The
galaxy also has low current star formation activity, so these bubbles are
evidently produced by the AGN rather than a starburst. We present spatially
resolved spectral analysis of the Chandra data of the
$\sim3^{\prime\prime}\times5^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim200{\rm~pc}\times350\rm~pc$)
nuclear bubble of NGC 4438. The power law tail in the X-ray spectra can be most
naturally explained as synchrotron emission from high-energy CR leptons. The
hot gas temperature increases, while the overall contribution of the
non-thermal X-ray emission decreases with the vertical distance from the
galactic plane. We calculate the synchrotron cooling timescale of the CR
leptons responsible for the non-thermal hard X-ray emission to be only a few
tens to a few hundreds of years. The thermal pressure of the hot gas is about
three times the magnetic pressure, but the current data cannot rule out the
possibility that they are still in pressure balance. The spatially resolved
spectroscopy presented in this paper may have important constraints on how the
AGN accelerates CRs and drives outflows. We also discover a transient X-ray
source only $\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ from the nucleus of NGC 4438. The source was
not detected in 2002 and 2008, but became quite X-ray bright in March 2020,

that the GeV gamma-rays are attributed to the external Compton process while

during the GeV outburst is consistent with the detection of MAGIC telescopes.

(TUVO), the discovery of TUVO-21acq, a new transient which we detected in the
UV using data from the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope aboard Swift. We detected
two separate outbursts and used the UV data to constrain source properties,
focusing on the amplitudes and timescales of the outbursts. During the first
outburst the source increased in brightness by >4.1, >2.4, and >3.5 magnitudes
and during the second outburst by >4.4, >3.4, and >3.6 magnitudes in the UVW1,
UVM2, and UVW2 bands, respectively. The outburst durations were in the range
6-21 days and 11-46 days, and the recurrence time is <316 days. We additionally
obtained an optical spectrum during quiescence with SALT. The spectrum
exhibited hydrogen Balmer series and helium emission lines, and a flat overall
spectral shape. We confirm the nature of the source as an accreting white dwarf
which underwent DN outburst based on photometric and spectroscopic properties.
This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the TUVO project strategy,
demonstrating its capability of discovering and classifying new, interesting UV
transients. We discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding
of the physics underlying DN outbursts, in particular with respect to the UV
emission. We examine the need for simultaneous UV and optical observations
during the onset of DN outbursts in order to help answer remaining questions,
for example in the characteristics and implications of the UV delay.",-0.26058877,-0.0719175,-0.046837196,C

that the relativistic particles and fields contribute significantly to the

increases with photon energy, while the time lags of the mHz QRM are soft and
decrease with photon energy. Fast recurrence of the mHz QRM, in a timescale of
less than one hour, has been observed during the outburst. During this period,
the corresponding energy spectra moderately change when the source transitions
from the QRM state to the non-QRM state. The QRM phenomena also shows a

remnants and supermassive BHs has only recently become unambiguously
established. GW190521, a gravitational wave signal detected by the LIGO/Virgo
Collaboration, provides the first direct evidence for the existence of such
intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). This event sparked and continues to fuel
discussion on the possible formation channels for such massive BHs. As the
detection revealed, IMBHs can form via binary mergers of BHs in the ""upper mass
gap"" ($\approx40 -120\,M_{\odot}$). Alternatively, IMBHs may form via the
collapse of a very massive star formed through stellar collisions and mergers
in dense star clusters. In this study, we explore the formation of IMBHs with
masses between $120$ and $500\,M_{\odot}$ in young, massive star clusters using
state-of-the-art Cluster Monte Carlo ($\texttt{CMC}$) models. We examine the
evolution of IMBHs throughout their dynamical lifetimes, ending with their
ejection from the parent cluster due to gravitational radiation recoil from BH
mergers, or dynamical recoil kicks from few-body scattering encounters. We find
that $ \textit{all}$ of the IMBHs in our models are ejected from the host
cluster within the first $\sim 500$ Myr, indicating a low retention probability
of IMBHs in this mass range for globular clusters today. We estimate the peak
IMBH merger rate to be $\mathcal{R} \approx 2 \, \rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$

acceleration, which gives rise to the observed non-thermal spectra. Stochastic
turbulent acceleration (STA) and diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) are
commonly cited as potential sources of high-energy particles in weakly
magnetized environments. Together, these acceleration processes and various
radiative losses determine the emission characteristics of these extra-galactic

  Aims: The purpose of this research is to investigate the dynamical interplay
between the STA and DSA in the radio lobes of FR-II radio galaxies, as well as
the manner in which these acceleration mechanisms, along with a variety of
radiative losses, collectively shape the emission features seen in these
extra-galactic sources.
  Methods: A phenomenologically motivated model of STA is considered and
subsequently employed on a magneto-hydrodynamically simulated radio lobe
through a novel hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework.
  Results: STA gives rise to a curved particle spectrum that is morphologically
different from the usual shock-accelerated spectrum. As a consequence of this
structural difference in the underlying particle energy spectrum, various
multi-wavelength features arise in the spectral energy distribution of the

then decreases with energy, reaching the maximum amplitude at 50-65 keV. In
addition, at the peak of the outburst, the mHz QPO shows a double-peak

in their pre-maximum spectra between 4000 and 5000 \AA (called Type~W and
Type~15bn, respectively). However, the physical cause of this bimodality is
still uncertain. Here we present pre-maximum spectral synthesis of 27 SLSNe-I

velocity ($v_{ \rm phot}$) evolution. We find that a $T_{\rm phot}$ limit of
12000~K separates the Type~W and Type~15bn SLSNe-I: Type~W objects tend to show
$T_{\rm phot}\geq$12000~K, while Type~15bn ones have $T_{\rm phot}
\leq$12000~K. This is consistent with the chemical composition of the studied
objects. Another difference between these groups may be found in their ejecta
geometry: Type W SLSNe-I may show null-polarization, implying spherical
symmetry, while the polarization of Type 15bn objects may increase in time.
This suggests a two-component model with a spherical outer carbon-oxygen layer
and an asymmetric inner layer containing heavier ions.

wider with time, i.e. with larger scatter, but the centroids of the

significant PA variations (confidence level 5-$\sigma$) were observed in 33% of

Finite temperature is also shown to limit the instability, with sufficiently

are usually thought to drive accretion. In particular, we identify extreme
scale height oscillations that occur twice an orbit throughout our disk. When
the scale height compresses, `nozzle' shocks form, dissipating orbital energy
and driving accretion. Separate from this phenomenon, there is also extreme
dissipation at the location of the tear. This leads to the formation of
low-angular momentum `streamers' that rain down onto the inner sub-disk,
shocking it. The addition of low angular momentum gas to the inner sub-disk
causes it to rapidly accrete, even when it is transiently aligned with the BH
spin and thus unwarped. These mechanisms, if general, significantly modify the
standard accretion paradigm. Additionally, they may drive structural changes on
much shorter timescales than expected in $\alpha$-disks, potentially explaining
some of the extreme variability observed in active galactic nuclei.",0.38481447,0.0036292975,0.21816678,B

Scintillation arcs appear to be ubiquitous in clean, high S/N observations,
their detection mainly limited by short observing durations and coarse
frequency channel resolution. This led the survey to be sensitive to nearby,
lightly scattered pulsars with high effective velocity -- from a large proper
motion, a screen nearby the pulsar, or a screen near the Earth. We measure the
arc curvatures in all of our sources, which can be used to give an estimate of
screen distances in pulsars with known proper motion, or an estimate of the
proper motion. The short scintillation timescale in J1731$-$4744 implies a
scattering screen within 12\,pc of the source, strongly suggesting the
association between this pulsar and the supernova remnant RCW 114. We measure
multiple parabolic arcs of 5 pulsars, all of which are weakly scintillating
with high proper motion. Additionally, several sources show hints of inverted
arclets suggesting scattering from anisotropic screens. Building on this work,
further targeted MeerKAT observations of many of these pulsars will improve
understanding of our local scattering environment and the origins of
scintillation; annual scintillation curves would lead to robust screen distance

reproduces the known scaling of the viscous $\alpha$-parameter, $\alpha \propto

$\beta$-parameter on the disc midplane, $B_{z0}$ is the net field, and $p_g $
is the midplane gas pressure. We generalize the argument to discs with strong
suprathermal toroidal magnetic fields, where the MRI growth rate is modified
from the weak-field limit. Additional sources of turbulence are required if
such discs are to become magnetically elevated, with the increased scale
heights near the midplane that are seen in simulations. We speculate that

Interestingly, the activity of FRB 180916 shows a well-regulated behavior, with
a period of 16.35 days. The bursts are found to occur in a duty circle of about
5 days in each period. In this study, we suggest that the bursts of FRB 180916
are produced by a strange star interacting with its planet. The planet moves in
a highly eccentric orbit around its compact host, with the periastron only
slightly beyond the tidal disruption radius. As a result, the planet will be
partially disrupted every time it passes through the periastron. The stripped
material from the planet will be accreted by the strange star, falling to the
polar cap region along the magnetic field lines and accumulated there. It will
finally lead to a local collapse when the crust at the polar region is
overloaded, triggering an FRB. The observed 16.35 day period corresponds to the
orbital motion of the planet, and the 5 day duty circle is explained as the
duration of the partial disruption near the periastron. The energy released in
each local collapse event can be as high as $\sim 10^{42}~\rm {erg}$, which is

Here, we collect all the bursts detected by {\it Fermi}-GBM with known

model-based GRB spectral-energy correlation analysis. A nearly complete GRB

emission energy $E_{\gamma, \rm iso}$ (the Amati relation), and (ii) the

$E_{\rm p,z}$ and $E_{\gamma, \rm iso}$ (and $L_{\gamma,\rm iso}$) is found for
both the Band-like and CPL-like bursts. The correlations take the form of
$E_{\rm p,z} \propto E^{0.41\pm0.06}_{\gamma, \rm iso}$ for our Band-like

nuclei (AGN), observed with the HST. The targets of the SUBWAYS sample were
selected with the aim to probe the parameter space of the underexplored AGN
between the local Seyfert galaxies and the luminous quasars at high redshifts.
Our targets, spanning redshifts of 0.1-0.4 and bolometric luminosities (L_bol)
of 10^45-10^46 erg/s, have been observed with a large multi-wavelength
campaign. Here, we model the UV spectra and look for different types of AGN
outflows. We find that 60% of our targets show a presence of outflowing H I
absorption, while 40% exhibit ionized outflows seen as absorption by either C
IV, N V, or O VI. This is comparable to the occurrence of ionized outflows seen
in the local Seyfert galaxies. All UV absorption lines in the sample are
relatively narrow, with outflow velocities reaching up to -3300 km/s. We did
not detect any UV counterparts to the X-ray ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), most
likely due to their being too highly ionized. However, all SUBWAYS targets with
an X-ray UFO demonstrate the presence of UV outflows at lower velocities. We
find significant correlations between the column density (N) of the UV ions and
L_bol of the AGN, with N of H I decreasing with L_bol, while N of O VI is
increasing with L_bol. This is likely to be a photoionization effect, where
toward higher AGN luminosities, the wind becomes more ionized, resulting in
less absorption by neutral or low-ionization ions and more absorption by
high-ionization ions. In addition, we find that N of the UV ions decreases as
their outflow velocity increases. This may be explained by a mechanical power
that is evacuating the UV-absorbing medium. Our observed relations are
consistent with multiphase AGN feeding and feedback simulations indicating that
a combination of both radiative and mechanical processes are in play.",-0.038581073,-0.012836224,0.27326292,C

of the nearby Type Ia supernova SN 2021fxy. Our observations include UV
photometry from Swift/UVOT, UV spectroscopy from HST/STIS, and high-cadence
optical photometry with the Swope 1-m telescope capturing intra-night rises
during the early light curve. Early $B-V$ colours show SN 2021fxy is the first
""shallow-silicon"" (SS) SN Ia to follow a red-to-blue evolution, compared to
other SS objects which show blue colours from the earliest observations.
Comparisons to other spectroscopically normal SNe Ia with HST UV spectra reveal
SN 2021fxy is one of several SNe Ia with flux suppression in the mid-UV. These
SNe also show blue-shifted mid-UV spectral features and strong high-velocity Ca
II features. One possible origin of this mid-UV suppression is the increased
effective opacity in the UV due to increased line blanketing from high velocity
material, but differences in the explosion mechanism cannot be ruled out. Among
SNe Ia with mid-UV suppression, SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp show substantial
similarities in their optical properties despite belonging to different Branch
subgroups, and UV flux differences of the same order as those found between SNe
2011fe and 2011by. Differential comparisons to multiple sets of synthetic SN Ia
UV spectra reveal this UV flux difference likely originates from a luminosity
difference between SNe 2021fxy and 2017erp, and not differing progenitor
metallicities as suggested for SNe 2011by and 2011fe. These comparisons
illustrate the complicated nature of UV spectral formation, and the need for
more UV spectra to determine the physical source of SNe Ia UV diversity.",0.13203123,-0.14377,0.23509562,C

distributed spins, while spins of the BHs originating in the field should be

simple population model for these dynamical and field binaries that uses spin
orientations as an anchor to disentangle these two evolutionary channels. We
then analyze binary BH mergers in the Third Gravitational-Wave Transient
Catalog (GWTC-3) and ask whether BHs from the isotropic-spin population possess
different distributions of mass ratio, spin magnitudes, or redshifts from the
preferentially-aligned-spin population. We find no compelling evidence that
binary BHs in GWTC-3 have different source-property distributions depending on
their spin alignment, but we do find that the dynamical and field channels
cannot both have mass-ratio distributions that strongly favor equal masses. We
give an example of how this can be used to provide insights into the various
processes that drive these BHs to merge. We also find that the current
detections are insufficient in extracting differences in spin magnitude or
redshift distributions of isotropic and aligned spin populations.",0.05233554,0.25985652,0.08593466,A
