profiling in biomedical studies. While an abundance of computational methods
exists for ""normalizing"" sequencing data to remove unwanted between-sample
variations due to experimental handling, there is no consensus on which
normalization is the most suitable for a given data set. To address this
problem, we developed ""DANA"" - an approach for assessing the performance of
normalization methods for microRNA sequencing data based on biology-motivated
and data-driven metrics. Our approach takes advantage of well-known biological
features of microRNAs for their expression pattern and chromosomal clustering
to simultaneously assess (1) how effectively normalization removes handling
artifacts, and (2) how aptly normalization preserves biological signals. With
DANA, we confirm that the performance of eight commonly used normalization
methods vary widely across different data sets and provide guidance for
selecting a suitable method for the data at hand. Hence, it should be adopted
as a routine preprocessing step (preceding normalization) for microRNA
sequencing data analysis. DANA is implemented in R and publicly available at

edit distances are variations of the Levenshtein distance and consider only
single-character edits. In forensic applications polymorphic genetic markers
such as short tandem repeats (STRs) are used. At these repetitive motifs the
DNA copying errors consist of more than just single base differences. More
often the phenomenon of ``stutter'' is observed, where the number of repeated
units differs (by whole units) from the template. To adapt the Levenshtein
distance to be suitable for forensic applications where DNA sequence similarity
is of interest, a generalized string edit distance is defined that accommodates
the addition or deletion of whole motifs in addition to single-nucleotide
edits. A dynamic programming implementation is developed for computing this
distance between sequences. The novelty of this algorithm is in handling the
complex interactions that arise between multiple- and single-character edits.

repertoire of Streptomyces, which are renowned as proficient producers of
bioactive Natural Products (NPs). The main goal of my work was to contribute
into the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms behind the evolution of
NP biosynthetic pathways. Specifically, the development of a bioinformatic
method that helps into the discovery of new NP biosynthetic pathways from
actinobacterial genome sequences with emphasis on members of the genus
Streptomyces. I developed this method using a comparative and functional
genomics perspective. My studies indicate that central metabolic enzymes were
expanded in a genus-specific manner in Actinobacteria, and that they have been
extensively recruited for the biosynthesis of NPs. Based in these observations,
I developed EvoMining, a bioinformatic pipeline for the identificatoon of novel
biosynthetic pathways in microbial genomes. Using EvoMining several new NP
biosynthetic pathways have been predicted in different members of the phylum
Actinobacteria, including the model organism S. lividans 66. To test this
approach, the genome sequence of this model strain was obtained, and its
analysis led to the discovery of an unprecedented system for peptide bond
formation, as well as a biosynthetic pathway for an arsenic-containing
metabolite. Moreover, this work also led to the identification of expansions on
a conserved metabolic node in the glycolytic pathway of Streptomyces. These
expansions occurred before the radiation of Streptomyces and are concomitant
with the evolution of their capability to produce NPs. Experimental analyses
indicate that this node evolved to mediate the interplay between central an NP
metabolism.",-0.34599382,-0.21532151,0.6866522,C

telomere started three decades ago and was finally completed in 2021. This
accomplishment was a result of a tremendous effort of numerous experts who
engineered various tools and performed laborious manual inspection to achieve
the first gapless genome sequence. However, such method can hardly be used as a
general approach to assemble different genomes, especially when the assembly
speed is critical given the large amount of data. In this work, we explore a
different approach to the central part of the genome assembly task that
consists of untangling a large assembly graph from which a genomic sequence
needs to be reconstructed. Our main motivation is to reduce human-engineered
heuristics and use deep learning to develop more generalizable reconstruction
techniques. Precisely, we introduce a new learning framework to train a graph
convolutional network to resolve assembly graphs by finding a correct path
through them. The training is supervised with a dataset generated from the
resolved CHM13 human sequence and tested on assembly graphs built using real
human PacBio HiFi reads. Experimental results show that a model, trained on
simulated graphs generated solely from a single chromosome, is able to
remarkably resolve all other chromosomes. Moreover, the model outperforms
hand-crafted heuristics from a state-of-the-art \textit{de novo} assembler on
the same graphs. Reconstructed chromosomes with graph networks are more

comparative evolutionary analyses in model and emerging non-model systems.
Understanding complexity and the functional components of the genome is an
untapped wealth of knowledge ripe for exploration. With the ""remarkable lack of
correspondence"" between genome size and complexity, there needs to be a way to
quantify complexity across organisms. In this study we use a set of complexity
metrics that allow for evaluation of changes in complexity using TranD. We
ascertain if complexity is increasing or decreasing across transcriptomes and
at what structural level, as complexity is varied. We define three metrics --
TpG, EpT, and EpG in this study to quantify the complexity of the transcriptome
that encapsulate the dynamics of alternative splicing. Here we compare
complexity metrics across 1) whole genome annotations, 2) a filtered subset of
orthologs, and 3) novel genes to elucidate the impacts of ortholog and novel
genes in transcriptome analysis. We also derive a metric from Hong et al.,
2006, Effective Exon Number (EEN), to compare the distribution of exon sizes
within transcripts against random expectations of uniform exon placement. EEN
accounts for differences in exon size, which is important because novel genes
differences in complexity for orthologs and whole transcriptome analyses are
biased towards low complexity genes with few exons and few alternative
transcripts. With our metric analyses, we are able to implement changes in
complexity across diverse lineages with greater precision and accuracy than
previous cross-species comparisons under ortholog conditioning. These analyses
represent a step forward toward whole transcriptome analysis in the emerging
field of non-model evolutionary genomics, with key insights for evolutionary
inference of complexity changes on deep timescales across the tree of life. We
suggest a means to quantify biases generated in ortholog calling and correct
complexity analysis for lineage-specific effects. With these metrics, we
directly assay the quantitative properties of newly formed lineage-specific
genes as they lower complexity in transcriptomes.",-0.22137824,-0.41456398,-0.2544293,C_centroid
