orthogonal to the direction of an ideal fluid in uniform motion. The conceptual
design used to demonstrate the generality of the aerodynamic aspects of energy
conversion - starting from a suggestive approach to the classical theory and a
geometric explanation of Betz's law - is defined by imposing compliance with
the minimum requirements that a turbine must have to approximate the ideal
efficiency of 16/27. The discovery of the role of the Betz's angles has
permitted demonstrating the theory in a more general context, extending it from
a flat, two-dimensional, representation to a deeper, three-dimensional,
understanding of the problem. The ensuing result, in particular the possibility
of obtaining constant yield and maximum efficiency through a finite topology of
the actuator cylinder, implies in principle feasibility with a real turbine

many turbulent flows, due to computational efficiency. Machine learning is a
promising approach to improve the accuracy of RANS simulations. One major area
of improvement is using machine learning models to represent the complex
relationship between the mean flow field gradients and the Reynolds stress
tensor. In the present work, modifications to improve the stability of previous
optimal eddy viscosity approaches for RANS simulations are presented and
evaluated. The optimal eddy viscosity is reformulated with a non-negativity
constraint, which promotes numerical stability. We demonstrate that the new
formulation of the optimal eddy viscosity improves the conditioning of the RANS

this proportional/orthogonal tensor decomposition for use in a physics-informed
data-driven turbulence closure, we use two neural networks (structured on this
specific tensor decomposition which is incorporated as an inductive bias into
the network design) to predict the newly reformulated linear and non-linear

flow past sinusoidally oscillating cylinder. Operating parameters like Reynolds
number, forcing frequency, amplitude and wavelength are systematically varied
and their effect on wake dynamics is investigated. Lift and drag coefficients
are plotted with cylinder position to characterize the flow. Further, flow
field is investigated using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD).
Time-resolved vorticity contours are obtained. These results are then processed
using POD algorithm. POD mode shapes and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots are
obtained for each case. Wake dynamics is analyzed using POD results. Flow
response to cylinder oscillations is characterized by the POD mode shape and
dominant frequency peaks in PSD plots. It is observed that flow is too
dissipative at lower values of Reynolds number. Further, effect of frequency
ratio is observed in achieving synchronized vortex shedding. High amplitude and

observed in a wide range of applications in biological, environmental and

transport mechanisms of the fluids at the interface between the layered

membrane fuel cells (PEM FC). Here, it is necessary to understand the transport
mechanisms of water throughout the cell constituents especially on the cathode
side, where the excess water has to be removed. This is crucial to choose
optimal operating conditions and improve the overall cell performance.
Pore-scale modeling of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and gas distributor has been
established as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes.
Investigating the interface between the hydrophobic porous GDL and the
hydrophilic gas distributor, a particular challenge is the combination and
interaction of the different material structures and wetting properties at the
interface and its influence on the flow. In this paper, a modeling approach is
presented which captures the influence of a hydrophilic domain on the flow in a
hydrophobic porous domain at the interface between the two domains. A
pore-network model is used as the basis of the developed concept which is
extended to allow the modeling of mixed-wet interactions at the interface. The
functionality of the model is demonstrated using basic example configurations
with one and several interface pores and it is applied to a realistic GDL

and fine water spray is an ideal mitigant due to numerous advantages. In this
work, interactions between a propagating hydrogen/air detonation wave and
circular water cloud are numerically studied. Eulerian-Lagrangian method
involving two-way gas-droplets coupling is applied, with a two-dimensional
configuration. Different droplet (diameter, concentration) and cloud (diameter)
properties are considered. Our results show that droplet size, concentration
and cloud radius have significant effects on peak pressure trajectory of the
detonation wave. After interacting with cloud, the detonation wave exhibits
three propagation modes, including perturbed propagation, leeward
re-detonation, and detonation extinction. Leeward re-detonation is analyzed
from unsteady evolutions of gas and liquid droplet quantities. The refracted
detonation wave inside the cloud is decoupled and propagates more slowly than
the one outside the cloud. The detonation re-initiation is from a local hot
spot, caused by shock focusing from upper and lower diffracted detonations.
Disintegration of water droplets proceeds when the detonation wave crosses the
cloud and multiphase interfacial instability is observed due to the difference
in effective density of the two fluids. Furthermore, detonation extinction is
observed when we consider various water cloud size. It is featured by quickly
fading peak pressure trajectories when the detonation passes the cloud, and no
local autoignition occurs in the shock focusing area. Evolutions of
thermochemical structures from the shocked area in an extinction process are
also studied. Moreover, parametric studies considering various droplet
concentrations and cloud radii are performed.",-0.22674322,0.019696891,0.102938995,C

flow $c-U(y)$ matches the Alfv\'en wave velocities $\pm B(y)/\sqrt{\mu\rho}$,
based on the local magnetic field $B(y)$, the magnetic permeability $\mu$ and
the mass density of the fluid $\rho$. It is shown that when the two critical
levels are close to each other, the critical layer can generate an instability.
The instability problem is solved, combining asymptotic solutions at large
wavenumbers and numerical solutions, and the mechanism of instability explained
using the conservation of momentum. For the shallow water MHD system, the paper
gives the general form of the local differential equation governing such
coalescing critical layers for any generic field and flow profiles, and
determines precisely how the magnetic field modifies the purely hydrodynamic
stability criterion based on the potential vorticity gradient in the critical

forced convection on segregation formation. As a reference case the
solidification of Sn-5 wt pct Pb alloy from the Hebditch and Hunt experiment is
taken. Applied forcing of convective flow is determined by the dimensionless
electromagnetic forcing parameter $F$. The study was carried out in the range
$-3.5\times 10^6<F<3.5\times 10^6$. Velocity profiles and flow patterns in the
liquid phase are obtained for different applied EM forcing conditions. As a
result of parametric analysis, the dependence of the Reynolds number on the
electromagnetic forcing parameter was obtained. Electromagnetic forces can
significantly affect the flow in the liquid bulk, increasing and slowing down
the velocity, as well as changing the circulating flow direction. Solute
concentration distribution analysis has shown that EM-forced convection does
not affect global solute segregation formation. For the two cases, segregation
channels were obtained. However, the analysis of the global segregation index
showed that an increase in the Reynolds number provokes a slight decrease in
this parameter. The main mechanism of segregation formation is transport of
solute rich liquid into the mushy zone. In considered numerical experiment
configuration, the penetration into the mushy zone is not large, and even a

Phase-based analysis involves perturbation analysis about a periodically

methodology, which takes the vorticity stretching to model transients in wind

accounts for two-way feedback between the atmosphere and the wakes. First, we
show that the vertical profile of the mean wind predicted with the new model

the predicted Reynolds stresses against wind tunnel data and show that the
dispersive stresses account for about 40% of Reynolds stresses. Finally, we

to some local fluid properties and follow simple, hard-wired active control
protocols. We study the case where instabilities are induced by switching the
particle temperature from hot to cold depending on whether it is ascending or
descending in the flow. A macroscopic transition from a stable to unstable
convective flow is achieved, depending on the number of active particles and
their excess negative/positive temperature. The stable state is characterized
by a flow with low turbulent kinetic energy, strongly stable temperature
gradient, and no large-scale features. The convective state is characterized by
higher turbulent kinetic energy, self-sustaining large-scale convection, and
weakly stable temperature gradients. The particles individually promote the
formation of stable temperature gradients, while their aggregated effect
induces large-scale convection. When the Lagrangian temperature scale is small,
a weakly convective laminar system forms. The Lagrangian approach is also
compared to a uniform Eulerian bulk heating with the same mean injection
profile and no such transition is observed. Our empirical approach shows that

coalescing speed gets the maximum and at this time the ratio of minor and major

turbulent regime, requires a method that is non-dissipative and stable at high
Reynolds ($Re$) numbers. For a compressible flow, it is known that discrete
conservation of kinetic energy is not a sufficient condition for numerical
stability, unlike in incompressible flows.
  In this study, we adopt the recently developed conservative diffuse-interface
method (Jain, Mani $\&$ Moin, $\textit{J. Comput. Phys.}$, 2020) along with the
five-equation model for the simulation of compressible two-phase flows. This
method discretely conserves the mass of each phase, momentum, and total energy
of the system. We here propose discrete consistency conditions between the
numerical fluxes, such that any set of numerical fluxes that satisfy these
conditions would not spuriously contribute to the kinetic energy and entropy of
the system. We also present a set of numerical fluxes\textemdash which
satisfies these consistency conditions\textemdash that results in an exact
conservation of kinetic energy and approximate conservation of entropy in the
absence of pressure work, viscosity, thermal diffusion effects, and
time-discretization errors. Since the model consistently reduces to the
single-phase Navier-Stokes system when the properties of the two phases are
identical, the proposed consistency conditions and numerical fluxes are also
applicable for a broader class of single-phase flows.
  To this end, we present coarse-grid numerical simulations of compressible
single-phase and two-phase turbulent flows at infinite $Re$, to illustrate the
stability of the proposed method in canonical test cases, such as an isotropic
turbulence and Taylor-Green vortex flows. A higher-resolution simulation of a

Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) that is applied to simulate orbital GTAW on
ultra-thin-walled titanium tubing. In this thesis, ultra-thin-walled tubing
refers to tubing where the wall thicknesses are less than 500 $\mu m$. Orbital
welding of tubing with this wall thickness requires both a sufficient heat
input to weld the tubing and an internal buttressing gas flow to ensure the
tube retains its geometrical integrity. The specific use case is for the
commercially pure grade 2 titanium tubing used in the ATLAS ITk cooling system
which is 2.275 $mm$ outer diameter and 300 $\mu m$ wall thickness at the weld.
The solver is created using the open source computational fluid dynamics
library OpenFOAM and each component of the solver is benchmarked against an
appropriate case. With the solver established, it is used to simulate a series
of welding procedures that were performed experimentally on the aforementioned
titanium tubing. Both the experimental and simulation results show a
`goldilocks' region where the weld heat input and inner buttressing gas flow
are moderated to a level where a fully penetrating weld is created but the
geometric integrity of the tube is not compromised. gtawFoam is then used to
simulate hypothetical tubing with larger and smaller wall thicknesses between
250 $\mu m$ and 350 $\mu m$. The results suggest that the required buttressing
gas pressure once achieved is relatively transferable between wall thickness
changes but applying enough heat so as to achieve full penetration is critical.
These results are then used to predict effective welding procedures for this
hypothetical tubing. gtawFoam is subsequently applied to the welding of turbine
blades. This includes the addition of multiple layers of filler metal to mimic
additive manufacturing.",-0.20084411,-0.06260272,-0.01226243,C

Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in fluid mechanics. DRL has been widely used in
optimizing decision-making in nonlinear and high-dimensional problems. Here, an

in an environment. In control theory terms, the cumulative reward would
correspond to the cost function, the agent to the actuator, the environment to
the measured signals and the learned policy to the feedback law. Thus, DRL
assumes an interactive environment or, equivalently, control plant. The setup
of a numerical simulation plant with DRL is challenging and time-consuming. In
this work, a novel python platform, named DRLinFluids is developed for this
purpose, with DRL for flow control and optimization problems in fluid
mechanics. The simulations employ OpenFOAM as popular, flexible Navier-Stokes

numerous executions of forward simulations under varying conditions. In this
work, a novel coupled theory-guided neural network (TgNN) based surrogate model
is built to facilitate computation efficiency under the premise of satisfactory
accuracy. The core notion of this proposed method is to bridge two separate
blocks on top of an overall network. They underlie the TgNN model in a coupled
form, which reflects the coupling nature of pressure and water saturation in
the two-phase flow equation. The TgNN model not only relies on labeled data,
but also incorporates underlying scientific theory and experiential rules
(e.g., governing equations, stochastic parameter fields, boundary and initial
conditions, well conditions, and expert knowledge) as additional components
into the loss function. The performance of the TgNN-based surrogate model for
two-phase flow problems is tested by different numbers of labeled data and
collocation points, as well as the existence of data noise. The proposed
TgNN-based surrogate model offers an effective way to solve the coupled
nonlinear two-phase flow problem and demonstrates good accuracy and strong
robustness when compared with the purely data-driven surrogate model. By
combining the accurate TgNN-based surrogate model with the Monte Carlo method,
UQ tasks can be performed at a minimum cost to evaluate statistical quantities.
Since the heterogeneity of the random fields strongly impacts the results of
the surrogate model, corresponding variance and correlation length are added to
the input of the neural network to maintain its predictive capacity. The

dimensionality of three-dimensional problems is so high that it is too

learning has become a promising approach to reuse well-trained two-dimensional

This paper proposes to reuse the baseline models trained on supercritical
airfoils to predict finite-span swept supercritical wings, where the simple
swept theory is embedded to improve the prediction accuracy. Two baseline
models for transfer learning are investigated: one is commonly referred to as
the forward problem of predicting the pressure coefficient distribution based
on the geometry, and the other is the inverse problem that predicts the
geometry based on the pressure coefficient distribution. Two transfer learning
strategies are compared for both baseline models. The transferred models are
then tested on the prediction of complete wings. The results show that transfer
learning requires only approximately 500 wing samples to achieve good
prediction accuracy on different wing planforms and different free stream

the forces on the blades, the smearing correction depended on an iterative
process at every time step, which is usually slower, less stable and less

suspended particles, carry vast quantities of sediment and nutrients from the
continental margins to the deep ocean. Due to their vast scale and extreme
aspect ratio, simplified depth- or channel-averaged models are required to
capture their dynamics. The inclusion of vertical structure (profiles of
velocity, depth, and turbulent kinetic energy) and levee overspill in these
models is in its infancy, and we demonstrate their importance in this study. We
present a new channel-averaged model that supports an arbitrary evolving
vertical structure and a compatible closure for the levee overspill. By
examining this new model, connections between the vertical structure and the
internal turbulent processes are revealed. Additionally, we find new
requirements for models of the front of the current, demonstrating a connection
between the vertical structure of the body and the mixing and erosion in the
head.
  In our new framework we build a full `proof of concept' model to illuminate
the substantial effect that vertical structure and levee overspill have on the
current. In this model, the vertical structure changes as part of the evolution
of the current: it self-stratifies. Quasi equilibrium solutions are
constructed, where the entrainment causes deepening. These solutions are not
stable, but rather weekly unstable and connected to a slowly evolving manifold:
we expect most environmental currents to evolve within such a manifold.
Equilibrium solutions are not stable either, the levee overspill removing the
dilute, low momentum fluid, which rejuvenates the flow, and this can cause a
positive feedback loop where the fluid becomes increasingly concentrated.

the two-fluid model of superfluid helium-4 based on smoothed-particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) is equivalent to solving a many-body quantum mechanical
equation under specific conditions. This study further verifies the existence
of this equivalence. First, we derived the SPH form of the motion equation for
the superfluid component of the two-fluid model, i.e., the motion equation
driven by the chemical potential gradient obtained using the Gibbs-Duhem
equation. We then derived the SPH form of the motion equation for condensates

Consequently, we discovered that a condition maintaining zero internal energy
for each fluid particle ensures the equivalence of the equations when the
quantum pressure is negligible. Moreover, their equivalence holds even when the
quantum pressure is nonnegligible if the quantum pressure gradient force equals
the mutual friction force. A zero internal energy indicates the thermodynamic
ground state, which includes an elementary excitation state. Therefore, the
condition can be sufficiently satisfied when the velocities of fluid particles
do not exceed the Landau critical velocity, which is not a stringent condition

found that in the asymptotic limit of small-scale forcing, the vorticity

where $r$ is the distance to the vortex center, $\alpha$ is the bottom friction
coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the inverse energy flux. Now we show that for a
spatially homogeneous forcing with finite $k_f$ the vorticity profile becomes
steeper, with the difference increasing with the pumping scale but decreasing
with the Reynolds number at the forcing scale. Qualitatively, this behaviour is
related to a decrease in the effective pumping of the coherent vortex with
distance from its center. To support this statement, we perform an additional
simulation with spatially localized forcing, in which the effective pumping of

method has not been used to simulate airplane aerodynamics, despite its
advantage of allowing courser grids. This may be credited to the failure of the
uncorrected ALM to accurately predict forces near the tip of wings, even for
simple configurations. The conception of the vortex-based smearing correction
showed promising results, suggesting such failures are part of the past. For
the non-planar configurations studied in this work, differences between the ALM

generated in the numerical domain differs from the calculated corrected
circulation. A vorticity magnitude correction is proposed, which improves the

floating-element balance to directly measure the skin-friction drag force,
hot-wire anemometry to acquire long-time fluctuating velocity and wall-shear
stress, and stereoscopic-PIV (particle image velocimetry) to measure the
turbulence statistics of all three velocity components across the boundary

mostly with net power saving losses due to the high-input power cost associated
with the high-frequency actuation. The low-frequency OSA pathway, however, with
its lower input power requirements, was found to consistently result in
positive net power savings of 5 - 10%, for moderate drag reductions of 5 - 15%.

jumpers with incipient directional takeoff and uncontrolled landing. However,
for these collembolans who live near the water, such skills are crucial for
evading a host of voracious aquatic and terrestrial predators. We discover that
semiaquatic springtails Isotomurus retardatus can perform directional jumps,
rapid aerial righting, and near-perfect landing on the water surface. They
achieve these locomotive controls by adjusting their body attitude and impulse
during takeoff, deforming their body in mid-air, and exploiting the
hydrophilicity of their ventral tube, known as collophore. Experiments and
mathematical modeling indicate that directional-impulse control during takeoff
is driven by the collophores adhesion force, the body angle, and the stroke
duration produced by their jumping organ, the furcula. In mid-air, springtails
curve their bodies to form a U-shape pose, which leverages aerodynamic forces
to right themselves in less than 20 ms, the fastest ever measured in animals. A
stable equilibrium is facilitated by the water adhered to the collophore.
Aerial righting was confirmed by placing springtails in a vertical wind tunnel
and through physical models. Due to these aerial responses, springtails land on
their ventral side 85% of the time while anchoring via the collophore on the
water surface to avoid bouncing. We validated the springtail biophysical

we aim to numerically investigate fully-developed turbulent pipe flows at
moderate-to-high Re ($361 \leq Re_\tau \leq 6,000$), employing LES. A grid
convergence study, using the WALE subgrid stress model, is presented for
$Re_\tau=361$. Additionally, the prediction accuracy of distinct subgrid-scale

OEEVM are too dissipative, whereas WALE, LDKM, and, more surprisingly, DSEM
perform rather well compared to experiments and results from DNS. Moreover, LES
utilizing WALE are performed and investigated in detail for six different
Reynolds numbers in the interval from $Re_\tau = 361$ to $6,000$ with gradually
refined grids. These computations allow an insight into what turbulence
information is retained when LES with a wall model is applied to such high

two-fold origin of the force in HIT: the plates restrict the presence of energy
structures in the slit, and pack intense vortical structures which stretch each
other causing the pressure to drop. At $Re_\lambda=100$, we find that small
plates cannot effectively pack structures, and this causes the force to behave
in a monotonic manner, with a maximum force for the smallest plate separations.
Medium and large plates show a non-monotonic behaviour of the force with plate
distance consistent with earlier studies, demonstrating that if the plates are
large enough to pack structures their size is not an important determinant of
the force. By decreasing $Re_\lambda$, we show that removing vortex stretching
decreases the attractive force, but does not completely eliminate it, and that
the non-monotonic character of the force is due to vortex stretching. These
results support the two-fold origin of the force, while shedding further light
on the mechanisms that generate it.",0.16179697,-0.03221192,-0.04537055,B

Hughes'), arxiv.Result.Author('Samuel S. Pegler')]","Understanding the dynamics of staircases in salt fingering convection
presents a long-standing theoretical challenge to fluid dynamicists. Although
there has been significant progress, particularly through numerical
simulations, there are a number of conflicting theoretical explanations as to
the driving mechanism underlying staircase formation. The Phillips effect
proposes that layering in stirred stratified flow is due to an antidiffusive
process, and it has been suggested that this mechanism may also be responsible
for salt fingering staircases. However, the details of this process, as well as
mathematical models to predict the evolution and merger dynamics of staircases,
have yet to be developed. We generalise the theory of the Phillips effect to a
three-component system (e.g. temperature, salinity, energy) and demonstrate the
first regularised nonlinear model of layering based on mixing-length
parameterisations. The model predicts both the inception of layering and its
long-term evolution through mergers , whilst generalising, and remaining
consistent with, previous results for double-diffusive layering based on flux
ratios. Our model of salt fingering is formulated using spatial averaging
processes and closed by a mixing length parameterised in terms of the kinetic
energy and the salt and temperature gradients. The model predicts a layering
instability for a bounded range of parameter values in the salt fingering
regime. Nonlinear solutions show that an initially unstable linear buoyancy
gradient develops into layers, which merge through a process of stronger
interfaces growing at the expense of weaker interfaces. Mergers increase the
buoyancy gradient across interfaces, and increase the buoyancy flux through the
staircase.",0.10220085,0.04762419,-0.024922816,B

interaction between shock and instability waves in two-dimensional supersonic
jet flows. The jet is considered to be of vortex-sheet type and 2D Euler
equations are linearised to determine the governing equations for shock,
instability waves, and their interaction. Pack's model is used to describe
shock waves, while instability waves are calculated using spatial stability
analysis. The interaction between shock and instability waves can be solved
analytically by performing Fourier transform and subsequently using the method
of steepest descent. Sound produced by the interaction between the instability
wave and a single shock cell is studied first, after which that due to a number
of cells follows. We find that the model developed in this study can correctly
predict the frequencies of the fundamental screech tone and its first and
second harmonics. We show that the predicted sound directivity, even from a
single shock cell, is in good agreement with experimental data. In particular,
this model shows the strongest noise emission close to the upstream direction
but the emitted noise starts to rapidly decay as the observer angle approaches
180 degrees, which is in accordance with experimental results; this suggests
that the effective noise from a single shock cell is far from of the monopole
type as assumed in the classical Powell's model. We find that the noise
directivity is very sensitive to the local growth rate of the instability waves
and the noise is generated primarily through the Mach wave mechanism.",0.111293286,0.089197814,-0.15049401,B

wave are studied, through Eulerian-Lagrangian method and a skeletal chemical
mechanism. The effects of gas/liquid equivalence ratio (ER), droplet diameter,
flight altitude, and Mach number on the ignition transient and chemical
timescales are investigated. The results show that the ratio of chemical
excitation time to ignition delay time can be used to predict the oblique
detonation wave (ODW) transition mode. When the ratio is relatively high, the
combustion heat release is slow and smooth transition is more likely to occur.
In heterogeneous ignition, there are direct interactions between the
evaporating droplets and the induction/ignition process, and the chemical
explosive propensity changes accordingly. The energy absorption of evaporating
droplets significantly retards the ignition of n-heptane vapor. In the
two-phase n-heptane mixture autoignition process, the ignition delay time
decreases exponentially with flight Mach number, and increases first and then
decreases with the flight altitude. As the liquid ER increases, both ignition
delay time and droplet evaporation time increase. With increased droplet
diameter, the ignition delay time decreases, and the evaporation time
increases. Besides, for Mach number is less than 10, the ratio of the chemical
excitation time to ignition delay time generally increases with the flight
altitude or Mach number. It increases when the liquid ER decreases or droplet
diameter increases. When Mach number is sufficiently high, it shows limited
change with fuel and inflow conditions. The results from this work can provide
insights into spray ODW initiation. The ODW is more likely to be initiated with
a smooth transition at high altitude or Mach number. Abrupt transition mode
tends to happen when fine fuel droplets are loaded.",-0.34633926,-0.08825116,0.1158018,C

theoretical research on Taylor-Couette flow. The flows of interest rotate
differentially with inner cylinder faster than outer one but are linearly
stable against Rayleigh's inviscid centrifugal instability. At shear Reynolds
numbers as large as 10^6, hydrodynamic flows of this type (quasi-keplerian)
appear to be nonlinearly stable: no turbulence is seen that cannot be
attributed to interaction with the axial boundaries, rather than the radial
shear itself. Direct numerical simulations agree, although they cannot yet
reach such high Reynolds numbers. This result indicates that accretion-disc
turbulence is not purely hydrodynamic in origin, at least insofar as it is
driven by radial shear. Theory, however, predicts linear magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) instabilities in astrophysical discs: in particular, the standard
magnetorotational instability (SMRI). MHD Taylor-Couette experiments aimed at
SMRI are challenged by the low magnetic Prandtl numbers of liquid metals. High
fluid Reynolds numbers and careful control of the axial boundaries are
required. The quest for laboratory SMRI has been rewarded with the discovery of
some interesting inductionless cousins of SMRI, and the recently reported
success in demonstrating SMRI itself by taking advantage of conducting axial
boundaries. Some outstanding questions and near-future prospects are discussed,
