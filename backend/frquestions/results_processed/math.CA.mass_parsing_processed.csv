absolutely general and can be carried out for any polynomial with simple zeros

quasi-orthogonality of $P$ with respect to $w$ allows us to give more precise
bounds on the degree of the electrostatic partner. In the case of orthogonal

generalize others. Additionally, for the Hermite--Pad\'e or multiple orthogonal
polynomials of type II, this approach yields a system of linear second-order

their zeros in terms of a vector equilibrium. More detailed results are

asymptotic expansion of a function across certain rays in the complex plane,
known as Stokes lines, as additional expansions, pre-factored by exponentially
small terms, appear in its representation. It was first observed by G. G.
Stokes while studying the asymptotic behaviour of the Airy function. R. B.
Dingle proposed a set of rules for locating Stokes lines and continuing
asymptotic expansions across them. Included among these rules is the ""final
main rule"" stating that half the discontinuity in form occurs on reaching the
Stokes line, and half on leaving it the other side. M. V. Berry demonstrated
that, if an asymptotic expansion is terminated just before its numerically
least term, the transition between two different asymptotic forms across a
Stokes line is effected smoothly and not discontinuously as in the conventional
interpretation of the Stokes phenomenon. On a Stokes line, in accordance with
Dingle's final main rule, Berry's law predicts a multiplier of $\frac{1}{2}$
for the emerging small exponentials. In this paper, we consider two closely
related asymptotic expansions in which the multipliers of exponentially small
contributions may no longer obey Dingle's rule: their values can differ from
$\frac{1}{2}$ on a Stokes line and can be non-zero only on the line itself.
This unusual behaviour of the multipliers is a result of a sequence of
higher-order Stokes phenomena. We show that these phenomena are rapid but
smooth transitions in the remainder terms of a series of optimally truncated
hyperasymptotic re-expansions. To this end, we verify a conjecture due to C. J.
