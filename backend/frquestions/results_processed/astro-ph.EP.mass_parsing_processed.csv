provided by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The sample
presented in this work consists of short period transiting exoplanets, with
inflated radii and large reported uncertainty on their planetary radii. The
precise determination of these values is crucial in order to develop accurate
evolutionary models and understand the inflation mechanisms of these systems.
Aiming to evaluate the planetary radius measurement, we made use of the
planet-to-star radii ratio, a quantity that can be measured during a transit
event. We fit the obtained transit light curves of each target with a
detrending model and a transit model. Furthermore, we used emcee, which is
based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, to assess the best fit posterior
distributions of each system parameter of interest. We refined the planetary
radius of WASP-140 b by approximately 12%, and we derived a better precision on
its reported asymmetric radius uncertainty by approximately 86% and 67%. We
also refined the orbital parameters of WASP-120 b by 2$\sigma$. Moreover, using
the high-cadence TESS datasets, we were able to solve a discrepancy in the
literature, regarding the planetary radius of the exoplanet WASP-93 b. For all
the other exoplanets in our sample, even though there is a tentative trend that
planetary radii of (near-) grazing systems have been slightly overestimated in
the literature, the planetary radius estimation and the orbital parameters were
confirmed with independent observations from space, showing that TESS and
ground-based observations are overall in good agreement.",-0.24341029,-0.2998339,0.04155426,C_centroid

L}$, the 'frequency of life' term in the famous Drake Equation. Measuring
$f_{\rm L}$ would give profound insight into how common life is and may help to
constrain origin-of-life theories. I propose $f_{\rm L}$ as the goal for the
DRAKE mission (Dedicated Research for Advancing Knowledge of Exobiology): a
transit spectroscopy survey of M-dwarf habitable zone terrestrial planets. I
investigate how the uncertainty on the observed value of $f_{\rm L}$ scales
with sample size. I determine that sampling error dominates over observational
error and that the uncertainty is a function of the observed $f_{\rm L}$ value.
I show that even small sample sizes can provide significant constraints on
$f_{\rm L}$, boding well for the transit spectroscopy approach. I perform a
feasibility study of the DRAKE mission using a nominal instrument design and
mission plan. Due to low observing efficiencies, DRAKE may need to be
incorporated into a wider-ranging deep-space or lunar observatory. A 50-planet
survey could constrain $f_{\rm L}$ to $\leq$ 0.06 (at 95% confidence) if the
sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0, or 0.03-0.2 if the sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0.1. This can
be achieved (on average) in 10 years using a 17-m telescope with an
unrestricted field-of-regard. DRAKE is a viable approach to attempting the

time series $x_t$ and the radial velocity (RV) time series $y_t$. Since planets
only cause modulation in RV, not in activity indicators, a high value of
$\hat{C}^2_{xy}(f)$ indicates that the signal at frequency $f$ has a stellar
origin. We use Welch's method to measure coherence between activity indicators
and RVs in archival observations of GJ 581, alpha Cen B, and GJ 3998. High
RV-H$\alpha$ coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 b, and high RV-S index
coherence at the frequency of GJ 3998 c, indicate that the planets may actually
be stellar signals. We also replicate previous results showing that GJ 581 d

signals that are not associated with rotation. Welch's power spectrum estimates
have cleaner spectral windows than Lomb-Scargle periodograms, improving our
ability to estimate rotation periods. We find that the rotation period of GJ
581 is 132 days, with no evidence of differential rotation. Welch's method may
yield unacceptably large bias for datasets with $N < 75$ observations and works
best on datasets with $N > 100$. Tapering the time-domain data can reduce the

model size for time series data. We demonstrate that statistical complexity is
an effective measure of the complexity of planetary features. Increasing levels
of qualitative planetary complexity correlate with increases in statistical
complexity and Shannon entropy, demonstrating that our approach can identify
planets with the richest dynamics. We also compare Earth time series with
Jupiter data, and find that for the three wavelengths considered, Earth's
average complexity and entropy rate are approximately 50% and 43% higher than
Jupiter's, respectively. The majority of schemes for the detection of
extraterrestrial life rely upon biochemical signatures and planetary context.

following McKay et al. (1999), which takes account of the sunlight absorption

yielded the global eastward wind around the equator with larger velocities at
higher altitudes except at around 70 km after $10^5$ Earth days. Although the
atmosphere is not in an equilibrium state, the zonal wind profiles is
approximately consistent with the observed one. Analysis on our experiments
suggests that the quasi-stationary stratospheric superrotation is maintained by
the balance between the meridional circulation decoupled from the surface, and
the eddies that transport angular momentum equatorward. This is different from,

disc midplane exhibit the non-linear three-wave resonant interactions between
streaming dust wave (SDW) and two inertial waves (IW). In the particular case
considered in this paper, SDW at the wavenumber $k^\bullet = 2\kappa / (g_z
t_s)$, where $\kappa$, $g_z$ and $t_s$ are, respectively, epicyclic frequency,
vertical gravitational acceleration and particle's stopping time, interacts
with two IW at the lower wavenumbers $k^\prime$ and $k^{\prime\prime}$ such
that $k^\prime < k_{\rm DSI} < k^{\prime\prime} < k^\bullet$, where $k_{\rm
DSI} = \kappa / (g_z t_s)$ is the wavenumber of the linear resonance between
SDW and IW associated with the previously discovered linear dust settling
instability. The problem is solved analytically in the limit of the small dust
fraction. As soon as the dynamical dust back reaction on gas is taken into
account, ${\bf k}^\bullet$, ${\bf k}^\prime$ and ${\bf k}^{\prime\prime}$
become slightly non-collinear and the emerging interaction of waves leads to
simultaneous explosive growth of their amplitudes. This growth is explained by
the conservative exchange with energy between the waves. The amplitudes of all
three waves grow because the negative energy SDW transfers its energy to the
positive energy IW. The product of the dimensionless amplitude of initially
dominant wave and the time of explosion can be less than Keplerian time in a
disc. It is shown that, generally, the three-wave resonance of an explosive
type exists in a wide range of wavenumbers $0 < k^\bullet \leq 2\kappa / (g_z
t_s)$. An explosive instability of gas-dust mixture may facilitate the dust
clumping and the subsequent formation of planetesimals in young protoplanetary

gravitational forces between the two bodies and the central body become
competitive, temporary captures with multiple close encounters become possible
outcomes: a Jacobi capture. We perform 3-body simulations in order to
characterise the dynamics of Jacobi captures in the plane. We find that the
phase space structure resembles a Cantor set with a fractal dimension of 0.4.
The lifetime distribution decreases exponentially, while the distribution of
the closest separation follows a power law with index 0.5. In our first
application, we consider the Jacobi capture of the Moon. We demonstrate that
both tidal captures and giant impacts are possible outcomes. Their respective
1D cross sections differ within an order of magnitude, evaluated at a
heliocentric distance of 1 AU. The impact speed is well approximated by a
parabolic encounter, while the impact angles follow that of a uniform beam on a
circular target. In our second application, we find that Jacobi captures with
gravitational wave dissipation can result in the formation of binary black
holes in galactic nuclei. The eccentricity distribution is approximately

orbital deflection. However, within their Jacobi volumes, where the
gravitational forces between the two bodies and the central body become
competitive, temporary captures with multiple close encounters become possible
outcomes: a Jacobi capture. We perform 3-body simulations in order to
characterise the dynamics of Jacobi captures in the plane. We find that the
phase space structure resembles a Cantor-like set with a fractal dimension of
about 0.4. The lifetime distribution decreases exponentially, while the
distribution of the closest separation follows a power law with index 0.5. In
our first application, we consider the Jacobi capture of the Moon. We
demonstrate that both tidal captures and giant impacts are possible outcomes.
The impact speed is well approximated by a parabolic encounter, while the
impact angles follow that of a uniform beam on a circular target. Jacobi
captures at larger heliocentric distances are more likely to result in tidal
captures. In our second application, we find that Jacobi captures with
gravitational wave dissipation can result in the formation of binary black
holes in galactic nuclei. The eccentricity distribution is approximately
super-thermal and includes both prograde and retrograde orientations. We
conclude that dissipative Jacobi captures form an efficient channel for binary
formation, which motivates further research into establishing the universality
of Jacobi captures across multiple astrophysical scales.",-0.14381051,0.042183295,-0.35795516,C

observations of disks around low- to intermediate-mass stars made with state of
the art interferometers and high-contrast optical and IR facilities have
revealed a diversity of substructures, some possibly planet-related. It is
therefore important to understand the physical and chemical nature of the
protoplanetary building blocks, as well as their spatial distribution, to
better understand planet formation. Since PPVI, the field has seen tremendous
improvements in observational capabilities, enabling both surveys of large
samples of disks and high resolution imaging studies of a few bright disks.
Improvements in data quality and sample size have, however, opened up many
fundamental questions about properties such as the mass budget of disks, its
spatial distribution, and its radial extent. Moreover, the vertical structure
of disks has been studied in greater detail with spatially resolved
observations, providing new insights on vertical layering and temperature
stratification, yet also bringing rise to questions about other properties,
such as material transport and viscosity. Each one of these properties - disk
mass, surface density distribution, outer radius, vertical extent, temperature
structure, and transport - is of fundamental interest as they collectively set
the stage for disk evolution and corresponding planet formation theories. In
this chapter, we will review our understanding of the fundamental properties of
disks including the relevant observational techniques to probe their nature,
modelling methods, and the respective caveats. Finally, we discuss the

decade is the discovery of multi-planet systems with sub-Neptune-sized planets

systems, which often display a remarkable degree of uniformity: the planets
have nearly equal sizes, regular orbital spacing, low eccentricities, and small
mutual inclinations. This uniformity stands in sharp contrast to the diverse
nature of the exoplanet sample considered as a whole (as well as our inner
solar system). We begin with a critical review of the observations -- including
possible biases -- and find that these peas-in-a-pod planetary systems are
apparently a common outcome of the planet formation process. Modest departures
from exact uniformity suggest additional patterns, such as the planet mass
slowly increasing with semi-major axis. The star formation process naturally
produces circumstellar disks with the properties required to produce these
planetary systems, although the solid material must move inward from its
initial location. We discuss primary modes of planetary assembly, the role of
orbital migration, and post-nebular atmospheric loss. Mature planetary systems
are found to be near their minimum energy (tidal equilibrium) configurations;
this finding provides a partial explanation for their observed properties and
indicates that efficient energy dissipation must occur. Finally, we consider
population synthesis models and show that peas-in-a-pod patterns emerge with
reasonable choices for the input parameters. Nonetheless, interesting

a low-amplitude nonlinear warp degrades at a resolution where MFM performs
well. A low-amplitude arbitrary warp tends to evolve towards a nonlinear steady
state. However, no such state exists in our thin disc with an angular

is one of the most uncertain parameters directly affecting collisional growth
of aggregates in planet-forming disks. Despite its importance, the monomer size
has not yet been meaningfully constrained by disk observations. Aims: We
attempt to derive the monomer size from optical and near-infrared (IR)
polarimetric observations of planet-forming disks. Methods: We perform a
comprehensive parameter survey on the degree of linear polarization of light
scattered by dust aggregates, using an exact numerical method called the
$T$-matrix method. We investigate the effect of the monomer size, aggregate
size, porosity, and composition on the degree of polarization. The obtained
results are then compared with observed polarization fractions of several
planet-forming disks at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Results: It is shown
that the degree of polarization of aggregates depends sensitively on the
monomer size unless the monomer size parameter is smaller than one or two.
Comparing the simulation results with the disk observations, we find that the
monomer radius is no greater than $0.4~\mu$m. The inferred monomer size is
therefore similar to subunit sizes of the solar system dust aggregates and the
maximum size of interstellar grains. Conclusions: Optical and near-IR
quantitative polarimetry will provide observational grounds on the initial
conditions for dust coagulation and thereby planetesimal formation in
planet-forming disks.",0.3089849,0.039774857,-0.24232352,B

distances, every exoplanet will be a single pixel, but temporal variations in
its spectral flux hold information about the planet's surface and atmosphere.
We test convolutional neural networks for retrieving a planet's rotation axis,
surface and cloud map from simulated single-pixel flux and polarization
observations. We investigate the assumption that the planets reflect Lambertian
in the retrieval while their actual reflection is bidirectional, and of
including polarization in retrievals. We simulate observations along a planet's
orbit using a radiative transfer algorithm that includes polarization and
bidirectional reflection by vegetation, desert, oceans, water clouds, and
Rayleigh scattering in 6 spectral bands from 400 to 800 nm, at various photon
noise levels. The surface-types and cloud patterns of the facets covering a
model planet are based on probability distributions. Our networks are trained
with simulated observations of millions of planets before retrieving maps of
test planets. The neural networks can constrain rotation axes with a mean
squared error (MSE) as small as 0.0097, depending on the orbital inclination.
On a bidirectionally reflecting planet, 92% of ocean and 85% of vegetation,
desert, and cloud facets are correctly retrieved, in the absence of noise. With
realistic noise, it should still be possible to retrieve the main map features
with a dedicated telescope. Except for face-on orbits, a network trained with
Lambertian reflecting planets, yields significant retrieval errors when given
observations of bidirectionally reflecting planets, in particular, brightness
artefacts around a planet's pole. Including polarization improves retrieving

through recent phase curve and low- and high-resolution emission and

analyzed the effect of the localized recombination of hydrogen on the
atmospheric dynamics and heat transport of ultra-hot Jupiters, finding that
hydrogen dissociation and recombination lead to a reduction in the day-to-night
contrasts of ultra-hot Jupiters relative to previous expectations. In this
work, we add to previous efforts by also considering the localized condensation
of clouds in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, their resulting transport
by the atmospheric circulation, and the radiative feedback of clouds on the
atmospheric dynamics. To do so, we include radiatively active cloud tracers
into the existing MITgcm framework for simulating the atmospheric dynamics of
ultra-hot Jupiters. We take cloud condensate properties appropriate for the
high-temperature condensate corundum from CARMA cloud microphysics models. We
conduct a suite of GCM simulations with varying cloud microphysical and
radiative properties, and we find that partial cloud coverage is a ubiquitous
outcome of our simulations. This patchy cloud distribution is inherently set by
atmospheric dynamics in addition to equilibrium cloud condensation, and causes
a cloud greenhouse effect that warms the atmosphere below the cloud deck.
Nightside clouds are further sequestered at depth due to a dynamically induced
high-altitude thermal inversion. We post-process our GCMs with the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code gCMCRT and find that the patchy clouds on ultra-hot
Jupiters do not significantly impact transmission spectra but can affect their

Vinfnity Leveraging Manoeuvres (VLM). The SOM has been established

demonstrated practically as a method of reducing overall mission Delta-V as
well as the Characteristic Energy, C3, at launch. Thus via these two
applications, the feasibility of missions to interstellar objects (ISOs) such
as 1I/Oumuamua can be analysed. The interplanetary trajectory optimizer tool
exploited for this analysis, OITS, permits IP selection as an encounter option

Steckloff'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Goldstein'), arxiv.Result.Author('Laurence Trafton'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philip Varghese'), arxiv.Result.Author('Parvathy Prem')]","Surface-bound exospheres facilitate volatile migration across the surfaces of
nearly airless bodies. However, such transport requires that the body can both
form and retain an exosphere. To form a sublimation exosphere requires the
surface of a body to be sufficiently warm for surface volatiles to sublime; to
retain an exosphere, the ballistic escape and photodestruction rates and other
loss mechanisms must be sufficiently low. Here we construct a simple free
molecular model of exospheres formed by volatile desorption/sublimation. We
consider the conditions for forming and retaining exospheres for common
volatile species across the Solar System, and explore how three processes
(desorption/sublimation, ballistic loss, and photodestruction) shape exospheric
dynamics on airless bodies. Our model finds that the CO2 exosphere of Callisto
is too dense to be sustained by impact-delivered volatiles, but could be
maintained by only ~7 hectares of exposed CO2 ice. We predict the peak surface
locations of Callisto's CO2 exosphere along with other Galilean moons, which
could be tested by JUICE observations. Our model finds that to maintain
Iapetus' two-tone appearance, its dark Cassini Regio likely has unresolved
exposures of water ice, perhaps in sub-resolution impact craters, that amount
to up to ~0.06% of its surface. In the Uranian system, we find that the CO2
deposits on Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon are unlikely to have been
delivered via impacts, but are consistent with both a magnetospheric origin or
sourced endogenously. We suggest that exosphere-mediated volatile transport
could produce these moons' leading/trailing CO2 asymmetries, and may be a
seasonal equinox feature that could be largely erased by volatile migration
during the Uranian solstices. We calculate that ~2.4-6.4 mm thick layer of CO2
could migrate about the surface of Uranus' large moons during a seasonal cycle.",0.084419385,-0.12546806,0.145105,A

The aim of our study is to obtain the near-ultraviolet to visible
(NUV-VIS, 0.35 - 0.95 micron) reflectance spectra of primitive asteroids with a
focus on members of the Themis and Polana-Eulalia complex families. This
characterization allows us to discuss the origin of two recent sample return
mission target asteroids, (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. Methods. We obtain
low-resolution visible spectra of target asteroids down to 0.35 micron using
the telescopes located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory and revisit
spectroscopic data that have already been published. We study the
characteristics of the NUV-VIS reflectance spectra of primitive asteroids,
focusing on data of the Themis family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex.
Finally, we compare the NUV characteristics of these families with (162173)
Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. In this work, we also study systematic effects due to
the use of the five commonly used stars in Landolt's catalog as solar analogs
to obtain the asteroid reflectance in the NUV wavelength range. We compare the
spectra of five G-stars in Landolt's catalog with the spectrum of the
well-studied solar analog Hyades 64, also observed on the same nights. Results.
We find that many widely used Landolt's G-type stars are not solar analogs in
the NUV wavelength spectral region and thus are not suitable for obtaining the
reflectance spectra of asteroids. We also find that, even though the Themis
family and the Polana-Eulalia family complex show a similar blueness at visible
wavelengths, the NUV absorption of the Themis family is much deeper than that
of the Polana-Eulalia family complex. We did not find significant differences
between the New Polana and Eulalia families in terms of the NUV-VIS slope.

system and may also have been a feature of Earth's past. However, relatively
little is understood about the dynamics of these ice-covered oceans, which
affect not only the physical environment but also any potential life and its
detectability. A number of studies have simulated the circulation of icy-world
oceans, but have come to widely different conclusions. To better understand and
narrow down these diverging results, we discuss energetic constraints for the
circulation on ice-covered oceans, focusing in particular on Snowball Earth,
Europa, and Enceladus. Energy input that can drive ocean circulation on
ice-covered bodies can be associated with heat and salt fluxes at the
boundaries as well as ocean tides and librations. We show that heating from the
solid core balanced by heat loss through the ice sheet can drive an ocean
circulation, but the resulting flows would be relatively weak and strongly
affected by rotation. Salt fluxes associated with freezing and melting at the
ice sheet boundary are unlikely to energetically drive a circulation, although
they can shape the large-scale circulation when combined with turbulent mixing.
Ocean tides and librations may provide an energy source for such turbulence,
but their strength remains highly uncertain for the icy moons, which poses a
major obstacle to predicting the ocean dynamics of icy worlds and remains as an
important topic for future research.",0.14905784,0.09493708,-0.26127058,C

associated with near-Earth asteroids, and 4% may be linked to near-Earth
comets. This implies that a significant fraction of meter-sized impactors
producing large bolides may have an asteroidal or cometary origin. In addition,
we found at least three bolides having hyperbolic orbits with high tensile
strength values. Meter-sized meteoroids of interstellar origin could be more

size dependent (e.g., radiation pressure), and with high angular resolution
observations we can take advantage of this natural spatial segregation.
Observations at different wavelengths probe different ranges of sizes, and
there is therefore a great synergy in multi-wavelength observations to better
constrain the optical properties of the particles. We present a new approach to
simultaneously model SPHERE and ALMA observations and apply it to the debris
disk around HD\,32297, putting the emphasis on the spatial distribution of the
grains with different $\beta$ values. This modeling approach requires few
assumptions on the actual sizes of the particles and the interpretation can
therefore be done a posteriori. We find that the ALMA observations are best
reproduced with a combination of small and large $\beta$ values ($0.03$ and
$0.42$) while the SPHERE observations require several intervals of $\beta$
values. We discuss the nature of the halo previously reported in ALMA
observations, and hypothesize it could be caused by over-abundant $\mu$m-sized
particles (the over-abundance being the consequence of their extended
lifetime). We model the polarized phase function at near-infrared wavelengths
and fluffy aggregates larger than a few $\mu$m provide the best solution.
Comparing our results with comets of the solar system, we postulate that the

supersonic dust in the planet's atmosphere is modeled, including ablation by
thermal evaporation and sputtering. The fraction of the accreted dust mass
deposited as gas-phase atoms is found to be large for close-in orbits and
massive planets. If mass outflow and vertical mixing are sufficiently weak, the
accreted dust produces a constant mixing ratio of atoms and remnant dust grains

Because the pressure of the ringwoodite-perovskite phase boundary defining the

TESS space telescope around the high proper-motion G2V star TOI-1422 ($V=10.6$
mag), 155pc away, with the primary goal of confirming its planetary nature and
characterising its properties. We monitored TOI-1422 with the HARPS-N
spectrograph for 1.5 years to precisely quantify its radial velocity variation.
The radial velocity measurements are analyzed jointly with TESS photometry and
we also check for blended companions through high-spatial resolution images
using the AstraLux instrument. We estimate that the parent star has a radius
and a mass of $R^*=1.019_{-0.013}^{+0.014} R_{\odot}$,
$M^*=0.981_{-0.065}^{+0.062} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Our analysis confirms
the planetary nature of TOI-1422b and also suggests the presence of a
Neptune-mass planet on a more distant orbit, the candidate TOI-1422c, which is
not detected in TESS light curves. The inner planet, TOI-1422b, orbits on a
period $P_{\rm b}=12.9972\pm0.0006$ days and has an equilibrium temperature
$T_{\rm eq, b}=867\pm17$ K. With a radius of $R_{\rm b}=3.96^{+0.13}_{-0.11}
R_{\oplus}$, a mass of $M_{\rm b}=9.0^{+2.3}_{-2.0} M_{\oplus}$ and,
consequently, a density of $\rho_{\rm b}=0.795^{+0.290}_{-0.235}$ g cm$^{-3}$,
it can be considered a warm Neptune-size planet. Compared to other exoplanets
of similar mass range, TOI-1422b is among the most inflated ones and we expect
this planet to have an extensive gaseous envelope that surrounds a core with a
mass fraction around $10\%-25\%$ of the total mass of the planet. The outer
non-transiting planet candidate, TOI-1422c, has an orbital period of $P_{\rm
c}=29.29^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ days, a minimum mass, $M_{\rm c}\sin{i}$, of
$11.1^{+2.6}_{-2.3} M_{\oplus}$, an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq,

diffraction-limited resolution that effectively spreads light from a source in
a region around the source point. In this letter, we show that the diffraction
limit of a 6 meter space telescope results in a point spread function of an
Earth-like planet that may contain additional unanticipated bodies for systems

objects, such as other planets and moons, can influence obtained spectra for a
putative habitable planet by producing spurious features and adding additional
uncertainty in the spectra. A model of the Earth observed by a 6 meter space
telescope as though it was an exoplanet shows that the light from the Earth
would be blended with the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars in various combinations

Sun-like stars is essential to the search for Earth analogues. Yet a lack of
reliable Kepler detections for such planets has forced many estimates to be
derived from the close-in ($2<P_{\mathrm{orb}}<100$ days) population, whose
radii may have evolved differently under the effect of atmospheric mass loss
mechanisms. In this work, we compute the intrinsic occurrence rates of close-in
super-Earths ($\sim1-2\,R_\oplus$) and sub-Neptunes ($\sim2-3.5\,R_\oplus$) for
FGK stars ($0.56-1.63\,M_\odot$) as a function of orbital period and find
evidence of two regimes: where super-Earths are more abundant at short orbital
periods, and where sub-Neptunes are more abundant at longer orbital periods. We
fit a parametric model in five equally populated stellar mass bins and find
that the orbital period of transition between these two regimes scales with
stellar mass, like $P_\mathrm{trans} \propto M_*^{1.7\pm0.2}$. These results
suggest a population of former sub-Neptunes contaminating the population of
Gyr-old close-in super-Earths, indicative of a population shaped by atmospheric
loss. Using our model to constrain the long-period population of intrinsically
rocky planets, we estimate an occurrence rate of $\Gamma_\oplus =
15^{+6}_{-4}\%$ for Earth-sized habitable zone planets, and predict that
sub-Neptunes may be $\sim$twice as common as super-Earths in the habitable zone

and CO2 depends strongly on both season and viewing geometry. In addition, we
found a strong spectral degeneracy with respect to the latter two indicating
that multi-epoch measurements and time-dependent signals may be required in
order to fully characterize planetary environments. Even for Earth and
especially for equatorial views, the variations in flux and strength of
absorption features in the disk-integrated data are small and typically $\leq$
10%. Disentangling these variations from the noise in future exoplanet

high pressure and temperature experimental results with a comprehensive
database of previous experiments to re-examine the systematics of Mo and W
partitioning. W partitioning is particularly sensitive to silicate and metallic
melt compositions and becomes more siderophile with increasing temperature. We
show that W has a 6+ oxidation state in silicate melts over the full
experimental fO2 range of $\Delta$IW -1.5 to -3.5. Mo has a 4+ oxidation state
and its partitioning is less sensitive to silicate melt composition, but also
depends on metallic melt composition. DMo stays approximately constant with
increasing depth in Earth. Both W and Mo become more siderophile with
increasing C content of the metal, so we fit epsilon interaction parameters. W
and Mo along with C are incorporated into a combined N-body accretion and
core-mantle differentiation model. We show that W and Mo require the early
accreting Earth to be sulfur-depleted and carbon-enriched so that W and Mo are
efficiently partitioned into Earth's core and do not accumulate in the mantle.
If this is the case, the produced Earth-like planets possess mantle
compositions matching the BSE for all simulated elements. However, there are
two distinct groups of estimates of the bulk mantle's C abundance in the
literature: low (100 ppm), and high (800 ppm), and all models are consistent

surface due to cometary activity might have affected the characteristics of
pits. In particular, we aim to understand whether signatures of the formation
mechanism of these morphological features can still be identified. To quantify
the amount of erosion sustained at the surface of 67P since it arrived on its
currently observed orbit, we selected 380 facets of a medium-resolution shape
model of the nucleus, sampling 30 pits across the surface. We computed the
surface energy balance with a high temporal resolution, including shadowing and
self-heating. We then applied a thermal evolution model to assess the amount of
erosion sustained after ten orbital revolutions under current illumination
conditions. We find that the maximum erosion sustained after ten orbital
revolutions is on the order of 80 m, for facets located in the southern
hemisphere. We thus confirm that progressive erosion cannot form pits and
alcoves, as local erosion is much lower than their observed depth and diameter.
We find that plateaus tend to erode more than bottoms, especially for the
deepest depressions, and that some differential erosion can affect their
morphology. As a general rule, our results suggest that sharp morphological
features tend to be erased by progressive erosion. This study supports the
assumption that deep circular pits, such as Seth1, are the least processed

particles ablate upon atmospheric entry, then the ring-derived vapor would
strongly affect the composition of Saturn's ionosphere and neutral
stratosphere. Our surveys of Cassini infrared and ultraviolet remote-sensing

predicted chemical consequences. We therefore conclude that either (1) the
inferred ring influx represents an anomalous, transient situation that was
triggered by some recent dynamical event in the ring system that occurred a few
months to a few tens of years before the 2017 end of the Cassini mission, or
(2) a large fraction of the incoming material must have been entering the
atmosphere as small dust particles less than ~100 nm in radius, rather than as
vapor or as large particles that are likely to ablate. Future observations or

unveil planet formation processes from atmospheric compositions. Several recent
studies suggested that atmospheric nitrogen, like carbon and oxygen, can
provide important constrains on planetary formation environments. Since
nitrogen chemistry can be far from thermochemical equilibrium in warm
atmospheres, we extensively investigate under what conditions, and with what
assumptions, the observable NH3 abundances can diagnose an atmosphere's bulk
nitrogen abundance. In the first paper of this series, we investigate
atmospheric T-P profiles across equilibrium temperature, surface gravity,
intrinsic temperature, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio using a 1D
radiative-convective equilibrium model. Models with the same intrinsic
temperature and surface gravity coincide with a shared ""universal"" adiabat in
the deep atmosphere, across a wide equilibrium temperature range (250--1200 K),
which is not seen in hotter or cooler models. We explain this behavior in terms
of the classic ""radiative zero solution"" and then establish a semi-analytical
T-P profile of the deep atmospheres of warm exoplanets. This profile is then
used to predict vertically quenched NH3 abundances. At solar metallicity, our
results show that the quenched NH3 abundance only coincides with the bulk
nitrogen abundance (within 10%) at low intrinsic temperature, corresponding to
a planet with a sub-Jupiter mass (< 1 MJ) and old age (> 1 Gyr). If a planet
has a high metallicity ($\ge$ 10$\times$ solar) atmosphere, the quenched NH3
abundance significantly underestimates the bulk nitrogen abundance at almost
all planetary masses and ages. We suggest modeling and observational strategies

icy bodies post-planet migration (i.e., between trans-Neptunian Objects or
TNOs) are too slow to crystallize any meaningful fraction of AWI. During planet

relatively little AWI crystallizes at lower impact velocities (less than ~2

survive planet migration is highly stochastic. However, if proto-EKB objects

connected to the so called ``resolution-linked bias'' (RLB) effect. We present

apply this tool to a few already or soon to be observed systems. On average, we
find that ignoring ISM absorption leads to biases in the MgII transit depth

generation space telescopes with UV coverage (e.g. LUVOIR, HABEX), which will
provide transmission spectra with significantly smaller uncertainties compared
to what obtained with current facilities (e.g. HST).",0.053441655,-0.16364254,-0.05939334,A

and Vanderburg & Rodriguez (2021) found that precise constraints on binary planets can be placed from radial velocities on directly imaged
exoplanets themselves; this is an exciting direction of further study considering the advances in directly imaged systems and high-resolution
spectroscopy, but is not our focus in this paper.",More recent work in Vanderburg et al.,Agol et al.,2022-12-15 19:00:01+00:00,Transit Duration and Timing Variations from Binary Planets,astro-ph.EP,['astro-ph.EP'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Joheen Chakraborty'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Kipping')]","Systems of two gravitationally bound exoplanets orbiting a common barycenter
outside their physical radii (""binary planets"") may result from tidal capture
during planet-planet scattering. These objects are expected to form in tight
orbits of just a few times their summed radii due to dynamical tides. As a
result of their close proximity, their transits overlap heavily, leading to the
deceptive illusion of a single planet of larger effective size, an effect
compounded in the presence of noisy data and/or long integration times. We show
that these illusory single-component transits, dubbed ""chimera transits"",
exhibit large-amplitude Transit Duration Variation (TDV) effects on the order
of hours, as well as smaller Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). We compute an
analytic approximation for the transit duration upper bound, assuming binary
planets with low impact parameter and orbits coplanar with the stellarcentric
orbit. We verify the accuracy of our expressions against dynamical simulations
of binary Jupiters using the luna algorithm, and provide a Python code for
numerical calculations of the TDV signal in binary planet systems
(github.com/joheenc/binary-planet-transits). Additionally, chimera transits
from binary planets exhibit TTVs of detectable amplitude and high frequency,
falling within the recently identified exomoon corridor. Due to their anomalous
shapes, depths, and durations, such objects may be flagged as false positives,
but could be clearly surveyed for in existing archives.",-0.3781994,-0.20839065,0.012045661,C

unified formalism for studying the structure of the phase space for
progressively higher values of the mutual inclination $i_{mut}$ between the two
planets' orbits. We propose a `book-keeping' technique yielding (after Jacobi
reduction) a clear decomposition of the secular Hamiltonian as
$H_{sec}=H_{planar} +H_{space}$, where $H_{space}$ contains all terms depending
on $i_{mut}$. We numerically compare several models obtained via expansion in
the orbital eccentricities or via multipole expansion. We find the mimimum
required truncation orders to accurately represent the dynamics. We explore the
transition, as $i_{mut}$ increases, from a `planar-like' to a `Lidov-Kozai'
regime. Using a typical (non-hierarchical) example, we show how the structure
of the phase portraits of the integrable secular dynamics of the planar case is
reproduced to a large extent also in the 3D case. We estimate semi-analytically
the level of $i_{mut}$ up to which the dynamics remains nearly-integrable. In
this regime, we propose a normal form method by which the basic periodic orbits
of the nearly-integrable regime (apsidal corotation resonances) can be computed
semi-analytically. On the other hand, as the energy increases the system
gradually moves to the `Lidov-Kozai' regime. The latter is dominated by two
different families of inclined periodic orbits ($C_1$ and $C_2$), of which
$C_2$ becomes unstable via the usual Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We discuss the
connection between the above families of periodic orbits. Finally, we study
numerically the form of the phase portraits for different mass and semi-major
axis ratios of the two planets, aiming to establish how generic are the
phenomena reported above as the systems parameters are chosen close to one or
more hierarchical limits.",-0.046568274,0.21373874,-0.30942494,C
