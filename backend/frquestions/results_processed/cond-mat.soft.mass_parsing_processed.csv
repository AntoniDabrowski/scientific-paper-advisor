mesogens embedded with chromophores like azobenzene. They undergo large
deformation when illuminated by light of a certain wavelength through
photochemical reaction, inspiring exciting new applications. However, despite
the recent progresses in both the experiment and theory of these materials, the
fundamental understanding of the temperature effect on their photomechanical
actuation through various molecular-to-mesoscale processes have remained
largely unexplored. This paper constructs a theoretical model to investigate
this temperature-modulated photomechanical actuation, by integrating different
temperature-dependent processes into a continuum framework. The model studies a
special working condition where the material is subjected to a uniaxial tensile
load, a prescribed temperature, and a polarized light illumination. We explore
the free energy landscape of the system and the uniaxial stress-stretch
responses under various conditions. We exploit the coupling between individual
controls of temperature and light in a single photomechanical actuation for
several working scenarios, including the temperature-modulated photomechanical
snap-through instability, specific work, and blocking stress. We study the
effect of the temperature-dependent backward isomerization of chromophores on
the photomechanical actuation. These results are hoped to motivate future

field vorticity and gravitational torque is called gyrotaxis. Using the method

gravitational torque and not the global density. Furthermore, we observe that
neutral squirmers form clusters more easily, whereas pullers require larger
gravitational torques due to their additional force-dipole flow fields. We do
not observe clustering for pusher squirmers. Adding a rotlet dipole to the
squirmer flow field induces swirling clusters. At high gravitational strengths,
the hydrodynamic interactions with the no-slip boundary create an additional

in relaxation spectra at lower temperatures on the high frequency flank of the
alpha-loss peak in analogy to the excess wings observed experimentally in
molecular glass-formers. Their remarkable finding leads to the question of
where the excess wing is located relative to the alpha-loss peak in the
susceptibility spectrum. I provide an answer by identifying the excess wing as
the unresolved Johari-Goldstein (JG) b-relaxation and using the reciprocal of
its relaxation time tau_JG to assess the location of the excess wing. The
Coupling Model (CM) has a history of being successful in determining
approximately the values of tau_JG(T) in molecular liquids whether the JG
beta-relaxation is resolved or not (i.e., excess wing). It is applied to the
simulation data and the results of tau_JG(T) successfully account for the
locations of the excess wings in the simulation spectra at different
temperatures. The time evolution of the dynamics of the distribution of
processes composing the JG b-relaxation suggested by the CM based on
experimental data in molecular glass-formers are in agreement with that given
by Guiselin et al. from simulations of a size-polydisperse mixture of N soft
spheres interacting with a repulsive power law pair potential. The agreement

While on spherical droplets $2n$ topological defects necessarily exist and can
induce icosahedral droplet shapes, the cylindrical topology is compatible with
a defect-free patterning. Nevertheless, once a modulation is introduced by a
mechanism such as spontaneous curvature, nontrivial patterns of order,
including ones with excess defects, emerge and have nonlinear effects on the

The influence of ion size on properties in a soft nanochannel is evaluated by

demonstrate that unlike in point-like ions, for finite sizes of ions, a uniform
distribution of chargeable sites within the polyelectrolyte layer causes
unphysical discontinuities in ion number densities not only for hydrogen ion

an increase in electrostatic potential and electroosmotic velocity and a
decrease in ion number densities. More importantly, we demonstrate that in
polyelectrolyte layer, pH-dependence of polyelectrolyte charge density makes
accumulation of hydrogen ions stronger than for the other positive ion species

solidify in the presence of magnetic fields due to the particles forming chains
along field lines. The magnetic forces between particles dominate the
solidification process and determine the yield stress of the material. Here, we
investigate how reversible chemical links between particles influence MRF yield
stress and stiffness through rheological testing in flow and oscillation mode.
First, we functionalize particles with phosphonate groups that are expected to
link through hydrogen bonding and find that this MRF exhibits up to 40% higher
yield stress and 100% higher stiffness than an MRF composed of unfunctionalized
particles. To explain this, we model the chemical attraction as an adhesion
that supplements dipole-dipole interactions between particles. Interestingly,
we find that the increase in yield stress is largest for dilute suspensions
that are expected to solidify into isolated chains, while the proportional
increase in yield stress is less for MRF with higher concentrations. This is
explained by the higher concentration MRF forming a body-centered tetragonal
(BCT) lattice in which interparticle adhesion forces are no longer aligned with
the field. To explore the possibility of dynamically tuning interparticle
interactions, we functionalize particles with polystyrene polymers with thymine
terminal groups that will only exhibit interparticle hydrogen bonding in the
presence of a linking molecule, namely melamine. We find that MRF formed with
these particles also exhibit up to a 40% increase in yield stress and ~100%
increase in stiffness, but only in the presence of melamine. In addition to
confirming the role of hydrogen bonding in increasing MRF performance, these

these zero modes to one of their boundaries in a manner that is protected

localization of their constitutive monolayers whose topological polarization
can be determined analytically. Importantly, the coupling between the layers
results in the emergence of omnimodal polarization, whereby in-plane and
out-of-plane edge modes localize on the same edge. We demonstrate these

dimensions to analyze the velocity distribution at different densities $\phi$
around the jamming density $\phi_J$ and at different low shear strain rates,
$\dot\gamma$. We then find that the velocity distribution is made up of two
parts which are related to two different physical processes which we call the
slow process and the fast process as they are dominated by the slower and the
faster particles, respectively. Earlier scaling analyses have shown that the
shear viscosity $\eta$, which diverges as the jamming density is approached
from below, consists of two different terms and we present strong evidence that
these terms are related to the two different processes: the leading divergence
is due to the fast process whereas the correction-to-scaling term is due to the
slow process. The analysis of the slow process is possible thanks to the
observation that the velocity distribution for different $\dot\gamma$ and
$\phi$ at and around the shear-driven jamming transition, has a peak at low
velocities and that the distribution has a constant shape up to and slightly
above this peak. We then find that it is possible to express the contribution
to the shear viscosity due to the slow process in terms of height and position
of the peak in the velocity distribution and find that this contribution
matches the correction-to-scaling term, determined through a standard critical
scaling analysis. A further observation is that the collective particle motion
is dominated by the slow process. In contrast to the usual picture in critical
phenomena with a direct link between the diverging correlation length and a
diverging order parameter, we find that correlations and shear viscosity
decouple since they are controlled by different sets of particles and that
shear-driven jamming is thus an unusual kind of critical phenomenon.",-0.10919739,-0.04311367,-0.17059946,A

has relevance in material science, biology, and the environment. Decades of
experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to understand this
fundamental symmetry-breaking transition. While experiments provide equilibrium
structures and shapes of crystals, they are limited to unraveling how molecules
aggregate to form crystal nuclei that subsequently transform into bulk
crystals. Computer simulations, mainly molecular dynamics (MD), can provide
such microscopic details during the early stage of a crystallization event.
Crystallization is a rare event that takes place in timescales much longer than
a typical equilibrium MD simulation can sample. This inadequate sampling of the
MD method can be easily circumvented by the use of enhanced sampling (ES)
simulations. An ES method enhances the fluctuations of a system's slow degrees
of freedom, called collective variables (CVs), by applying a bias potential,
and thereby transforms the system from one state to the other within a short
timescale. The most crucial part of an ES method is to find suitable CVs which
often needs intuition and several trial-and-error optimization steps. Over the
years, a plethora of CVs has been developed and applied in the study of
crystallization. In this review, we provide a brief overview of CVs that have
been developed and used in ES simulations to study crystallization from melt or
solution. These CVs can be categorized mainly into four types: (i) spherical
particle-based, (ii) molecular template-based, (iii) physical property-based,

liquid-liquid phase separation in polymer networks and biological cells,
refrigeration cycles of nanosponges, and energy storage in supercapacitors. The
deformation process of host porous matrices, coupled with the adsorption of
guest molecules, plays an essential role in developing stimuli-responsive
materials. In particular, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit promising
stimuli-responsiveness and molecular adsorption selectivity, that enable
various applications based on MOFs. The adsorption of guest molecules in MOFs
changes the crystalline structure and elastic moduli of the host matrices.
Thus, the substances become elastically heterogeneous when adsorbed/desorbed
sites coexist. However, the role of elastic heterogeneity in the
adsorption-desorption transition has been overlooked. Here we show the
asymmetric role of elastic heterogeneity in the adsorption-desorption
transition. We construct a minimal model incorporating adsorption-induced
lattice expansion and an increase in the elastic moduli, and discover that the
transition is hindered entropically during the adsorption process and
energetically during the desorption process, leading to the strong hysteretic
nature of the transition. Furthermore, the adsorbed/desorbed sites exhibit
spatially heterogeneous domain formation due to elastic heterogeneity, implying
that the domain morphology and interfacial area between the adsorbed/desorbed
sites can be controlled by elastic heterogeneity. Our results provide a

Recent research works have revealed that droplets sit, slide and spread
anisotropically on uniaxially stretched soft substrates, showing an enhanced
wettability and contact line mobility along the stretching direction. This
phenomenon arises from the anisotropic deformation of the substrate below the
contact line. Here, we investigate how the stretching of soft substrates
affects droplets drying. We observe that water droplet evaporates with an
elongated non-circular contact line on the stretched substrates and switches
the elongation direction during evaporation. The contact line velocity and its
temporal evolution depend on the orientation of the contact line relative to
the stretching direction. On the substrate stretched by 250%, the contact line
recedes about 20% of the droplet lifetime earlier along the stretching
direction and faster than its perpendicular direction. When nanoparticles are
added into the liquid, the circular deposition pattern, i.e., the so-called
coffee-ring, becomes elongated along the direction perpendicular to the
stretching direction. Particularly, such non-circular deposition pattern
exhibits periodic height gradients along its rim. The finer structure of the
pattern can be controlled by applying different stretching ratios to the soft
substrate and thus are correlated to the anisotropic surface stresses near the

two dimensional substrate with birth and death. Most of the previous studies of
polar flock with birth and death have assumed the compressible flock, such that
the local density of flock is completely ignored. Effect of birth and death of
particles on the flock with moderate density is focus of our study. System is
modeled using coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations of motion for local density
and velocity of the flock and solved using numerical integration of the
nonlinear coupled partial differential equations of motion and linearised
hydrodynamics about the broken symmetry state. We studied the ordering kinetics
as well as the steady state properties of the immortal flock and flock with
finite birth and death rate. The ordering kinetics of the velocity field
remains unaffected whereas the density field shows a crossover from asymptotic
growth exponent $5/6$ for the immortal flock to diffusive limit $1/3$ for large
birth and death rates. In the steady state, the presence of birth and death
rate leads to the suppression of speed of sound wave and density fluctuations
in the system.",-0.518468,0.17214713,-0.08895635,A

to transport various cargoes along microtubules, converting chemical energy to
directed movements. To describe the non-thermal fluctuations generated by the
complex environment in living cells, we establish a bottom-up model to mimic
the intracellular environment, by introducing an active bath consisting of
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) particles. Simulations of the model system show
that kinesin and the probe attached to it are accelerated by such active bath.
Further, we provide a theoretical insight into the simulation result by
deriving a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the probe with a mean-field
method, wherein an effective friction kernel and fluctuating noise terms are
obtained explicitly. Numerical solutions of the GLE show very good agreement
with simulation results. We sample such noises, calculate their variances and
non-Gaussian parameters, and reveal that the dominant contribution to probe
acceleration is attributed to noise variance.",-0.16840476,-0.04572308,0.049942113,A
