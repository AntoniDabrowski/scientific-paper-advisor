designs for a future, luminous, energy frontier electron-hadron ($eh$)
scattering experiment at the LHC in the thirties for which key physics topics
and their relation to the hadron-hadron HL-LHC physics programme are discussed.
Demands are derived set by these physics topics on the design of the LHeC
detector, a corresponding update of which is described. Optimisations on the
accelerator design, especially the interaction region (IR), are presented.
Initial accelerator considerations indicate that a common IR is possible to be
built which alternately could serve $eh$ and $hh$ collisions while other
experiments would stay on $hh$ in either condition. A forward-backward
symmetrised option of the LHeC detector is sketched which would permit
extending the LHeC physics programme to also include aspects of hadron-hadron
physics. The vision of a joint $eh$ and $hh$ physics experiment is shown to
open new prospects for solving fundamental problems of high energy heavy-ion
physics including the partonic structure of nuclei and the emergence of
hydrodynamics in quantum field theory while the genuine TeV scale DIS physics
is of unprecedented rank.",-0.05855537,0.1283864,0.057614062,C

branching fraction of the $D^+_s \to \pi^+ \pi^0 \eta^{\prime}$ decay is

6.32~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, we report the amplitude analysis and
branching-fraction measurement of the $D^+_s \to \pi^+ \pi^0 \eta^{\prime}$
decay. We find that the dominant intermediate process is $D^+_s \to\rho^+
\eta^{\prime}$ and the significances of other resonant and nonresonant
processes are all less than $3\sigma$. The upper limits on the branching
fractions of $S$-wave and $P$-wave nonresonant components are set to $0.10\%$
and $0.74\%$ at the $90\%$ confidence level, respectively. In addition, the
branching fraction of the $D^+_s \to \pi^+ \pi^0 \eta^{\prime}$ decay is
measured to be $(6.15\pm0.25(\rm stat.)\pm0.18(\rm syst.))\%$, which receives

muon magnetic anomaly is $a_\mu(FNAL)=116592040(54)\times10^{-11}$. This result
is in good agreement with Brookhaven's previous measurement. The new world
average, $a_\mu(Exp)=116592061(41)\times10^{-11}$, shows a difference from the
theoretical value of the Standard Model (SM),
$a_\mu(SM)=116591810(43)\times10^{-11}$, of 4.2 standard deviations, strongly
hinting at physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiment requires the
simultaneous measurement of the muon precession frequency, the magnetic field,

produce a large number of particles along the beam collision axis, outside of
the acceptance of existing LHC experiments. The proposed Forward Physics
Facility (FPF), to be located several hundred meters from the ATLAS interaction
point and shielded by concrete and rock, will host a suite of experiments to
probe Standard Model (SM) processes and search for physics beyond the Standard
Model (BSM). In this report, we review the status of the civil engineering
plans and the experiments to explore the diverse physics signals that can be
uniquely probed in the forward region. FPF experiments will be sensitive to a
broad range of BSM physics through searches for new particle scattering or
decay signatures and deviations from SM expectations in high statistics
analyses with TeV neutrinos in this low-background environment. High statistics
neutrino detection will also provide valuable data for fundamental topics in
perturbative and non-perturbative QCD and in weak interactions. Experiments at
the FPF will enable synergies between forward particle production at the LHC

produce a large number of particles along the beam collision axis, outside of
the acceptance of existing LHC experiments. The proposed Forward Physics
Facility (FPF), to be located several hundred meters from the ATLAS interaction
point and shielded by concrete and rock, will host a suite of experiments to
probe Standard Model (SM) processes and search for physics beyond the Standard
Model (BSM). In this report, we review the status of the civil engineering
plans and the experiments to explore the diverse physics signals that can be
uniquely probed in the forward region. FPF experiments will be sensitive to a
broad range of BSM physics through searches for new particle scattering or
decay signatures and deviations from SM expectations in high statistics
analyses with TeV neutrinos in this low-background environment. High statistics
neutrino detection will also provide valuable data for fundamental topics in
perturbative and non-perturbative QCD and in weak interactions. Experiments at
the FPF will enable synergies between forward particle production at the LHC
and astroparticle physics to be exploited. We report here on these physics
topics, on infrastructure, detector, and simulation studies, and on future

associated relationships. Where previously these sets of data have been
formulated as series or image data to match the available machine learning
architectures, with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs), these systems
can be learned natively as graphs. This allows a wide variety of high- and
low-level physical features to be attached to measurements and, by the same
token, a wide variety of HEP tasks to be accomplished by the same GNN
architectures. GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging,
generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in
industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements
in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly
aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN
capabilities to unique HEP obstacles. We present here a range of these
capabilities, predictions of which are currently being well-adopted in HEP
communities, and which are still immature. We hope to capture the landscape of

measurements of the branching ratios for the flavor-changing neutral current

is observed for the first time, using a data set corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 6.32~$\rm fb^{-1}$ recorded by the BESIII detector at the
centre-of-mass energies between 4.178 and 4.226~GeV. The first amplitude
analysis of $D_{s}^{+} \to K^+\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ reveals the sub-structures
in this decay and determines the fractions and relative phases of different
intermediate processes. The dominant intermediate process is $D_s^+ \to
K^{*0}\rho^+$, with a fit fraction of
$(40.9\pm2.8_{\rm{stat.}}\pm1.5_{\rm{syst.}})\%$. With the detection efficiency
based on our amplitude analysis, the absolute branching fraction for $D_{s}^{+}

$(9.75\pm0.54_{\rm{stat.}}\pm0.17_{\rm{syst.}})\times 10^{-3}$.",-0.18972957,-0.3981542,0.46000433,C

is observed for the first time, using a data set corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 6.32~$\rm fb^{-1}$ recorded by the BESIII detector at the
centre-of-mass energies between 4.178 and 4.226~GeV. The first amplitude
analysis of $D_{s}^{+} \to K^+\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$ reveals the sub-structures
in this decay and determines the fractions and relative phases of different
intermediate processes. The dominant intermediate process is $D_s^+ \to
K^{*0}\rho^+$, with a fit fraction of
$(40.9\pm2.8_{\rm{stat.}}\pm1.5_{\rm{syst.}})\%$. With the detection efficiency
based on our amplitude analysis, the absolute branching fraction for $D_{s}^{+}

$(9.75\pm0.54_{\rm{stat.}}\pm0.17_{\rm{syst.}})\times 10^{-3}$.",-0.18972957,-0.3981542,0.46000433,C

a fit fraction of $(40.5\pm2.8_{\rm{stat.}}\pm1.5_{\rm{syst.}})\%$. With the
detection efficiency based on our amplitude analysis, the absolute branching

Spallation Source neutrino Super Beam (ESS$\nu$SB) feasibility study. This
facility has been proposed after the measurements reported in 2012 of a
relatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, which raised
the possibility of observing potential CP violation in the leptonic sector with
conventional neutrino beams. The measured value of $\theta_{13}$ also
privileges the $2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum for the discovery of CP violation
instead of the more typically studied $1^{st}$ maximum. The sensitivity at this
$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum is about three times higher than at the $1^{st}$
one, which implies a reduced influence of systematic errors. Working at the
$2^{nd}$ oscillation maximum requires a very intense neutrino beam with an
appropriate energy. The world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source,
the European Spallation Source (ESS), will have a proton linac operating at
5\,MW power, 2\,GeV kinetic energy and 14~Hz repetition rate (3~ms pulse
duration, 4\% duty cycle) for neutron production. In this design study it is
proposed to double the repetition rate and compress the beam pulses to the
level of microseconds in order to provide an additional 5~MW proton beam for
neutrino production. The physics performance has been evaluated for such a
neutrino super beam, in conjunction with a megaton-scale underground water
Cherenkov neutrino detector installed at a distance of 360--550\,km from ESS.

standard model predictions with an unprecedented level of precision, as well as
seeking deviations that can manifest the presence of physics beyond the
standard model. These measurements are in general designed for being easily
comparable to any present or future theoretical prediction, and to achieve this
goal it is important to keep the model dependence to a minimum. Nevertheless,
the reduction of the model dependence usually comes at the expense of the
measurement precision, preventing to exploit the full potential of the signal
extraction procedure. In this paper a novel methodology based on the machine
learning concept of domain adaptation is proposed, which allows using a complex

elastic-scattering events were recorded at $\sqrt{s} = 13~$TeV with an
integrated luminosity of $340~\mu \textrm{b}^{-1}$ using the ALFA subdetector

of the real part to the imaginary part of the elastic-scattering amplitude in
the limit $t \rightarrow 0$. These parameters are determined from a fit to the
differential elastic cross section using the optical theorem and different
parameterizations of the $t$-dependence. The results for

decade (2025-35) are constructing and operating major facilities and developing
critical enabling capabilities. The major facilities for this decade are the
CMB-S4 project, a new Stage-V spectroscopic survey facility, and existing

$\theta_{14}, \theta_{24}$, and $\theta_{34}$, only $\theta_{24}$ was fitted
for, as $\theta_{14}$ was negligible and $\theta_{34} = 0$ was considered a
conservative assumption. We present results of an analysis where we include
$\theta_{34}$ to the fitted model. Both a frequentist and Bayesian analysis
were conducted, with fits done in terms of the mass-squared splitting $\Delta
m_{41}^2$ and the mixing matrix parameters $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^2$.
The frequentist analysis finds a best fit at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\
\textrm{eV}^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.04$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a
p-value of 5.2% assuming Wilks' Theorem with 3 degrees of freedom.
Pseudoexperiments are indicating a smaller p-value 2.7%. The Bayesian analysis
finds a similar best fit point at $\Delta m_{41}^2 = 5.0\ \textrm{eV}^2$,
$|U_{\mu4}|^2 = 0.02$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2 = 0.006$, with a Bayes factor
indicating a ``Very Strong'' preference for this sterile hypothesis over the
null hypothesis.",0.018521186,0.13736275,-0.1282964,C

analysis is based on $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded from
2015 to 2018. Previous searches for diphoton resonances at the LHC have
explored masses down to 65 GeV, finding no evidence of new particles. This
search exploits the particular kinematics of events with pairs of closely
spaced photons reconstructed in the detector, allowing examination of invariant
masses down to 10 GeV. The presented strategy covers a region previously
unexplored at hadron colliders because of the experimental challenges of
recording low-energy photons and estimating the backgrounds. No significant
excess is observed and the reported limits provide the strongest bound on
promptly decaying axion-like particles coupling to gluons and photons for

of $3.19$ fb$^{-1}$ collected with the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass
energy of 4.178 GeV, the branching fraction of the inclusive decay of the
$D_s^+$ meson to final states including at least three charged pions is
measured for the first time to be ${\cal B}(D_s^+\to\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^- X) =
(32.81 \pm 0.35_{\rm stat} \pm {0.82_{\rm syst}})\%$. In this measurement the
charged pions from $K_S^0$ meson decays are excluded. The partial branching
fractions of $D_s^+\to\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^- X$ are also measured as a function of
the $\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ invariant mass.",-0.0505866,-0.2867258,0.39948866,C
