transonic steady-states pass through the sonic line, they produce singularities

stability. For any relaxation time, by means of elaborate singularity analysis,
we first investigate the structural stability of the C^1-smooth transonic
steady-states, once the perturbations of the initial data and the doping
profiles are small enough. Moreover, when the relaxation time is large enough,
under the condition that the electric field is positive at the shock location,
we prove that the transonic shock steady-states are structurally stable with
respect to small perturbations of the supersonic doping profile. Furthermore,
we show the linearly dynamic instability for these transonic shock
steady-states provided that the electric field is suitable negative. The proofs
for the structural stability results are based on singularity analysis, a
monotonicity argument on the shock position and the downstream density, and the
stability analysis of supersonic and subsonic solutions. The linear dynamic
instability of the steady transonic shock for Euler-Poisson equations can be
transformed to the ill-posedness of a free boundary problem for the

to the linear theory, the domain of the generator is, in general, not invariant

its evaluation at smooth functions. Furthermore, we provide Chernoff
approximation results for convex monotone semigroups and show that
approximation schemes based on the same infinitesimal behaviour lead to the

extremely challenging. In [18], Elgindi proved that the 3D axisymmetric Euler
equations with no swirl and $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial velocity develops a finite
time singularity. Inspired by Elgindi's work, we proved that the 3D
axisymmetric Euler and 2D Boussinesq equations with $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial
velocity and boundary develop a stable asymptotically (or approximately)
self-similar finite time singularity [8]. On the other hand, the authors of
[35,52] recently showed that blowup solutions to the 3D Euler equations are
hydrodynamically unstable. The instability results obtained in [35,52] require
some strong regularity assumption on the initial data, which is not satisfied
by the $C^{1,\alpha}$ velocity field. In this paper, we generalize the analysis
of [8,18,35,52] to show that the blowup solutions of the 3D Euler and 2D
Boussinesq equations with $C^{1,\alpha}$ velocity are unstable under the notion
of stability introduced in [35,52]. These two seemingly contradictory results
reflect the difference of the two approaches in studying the stability of 3D
Euler blowup solutions. The stability analysis of the blowup solution obtained
in [8,18] is based on the stability of a dynamically rescaled blowup profile in
space and time, which is nonlinear in nature. The linear stability analysis in
[35,52] is performed by directly linearizing the 3D Euler equations around a
blowup solution in the original variables. It does not take into account the
changes in the blowup time, the dynamic changes of the rescaling rate of the
perturbed blowup profile and the blowup exponent of the original 3D Euler
equations using a perturbed initial condition when there is an approximate
self-similar blowup profile. Such information has been used in an essential way

is given by an involution on the space, and the rate of collision is only
supposed to be bounded and lower semi-continuous. We prove existence and
uniqueness of measure solutions as well as their convergence to equilibrium,
using the graph-theoretical notion of connectivity. We first characterise the
shape of equilibria in terms of connected components of a graph on the state
space, which can be associated to the initial data of the problem.

convergence is bounded below, we then show exponential convergence towards the
unique steady-state associated to the initial condition. The article is

the existence of a critical mass number $c_0\in(0,\infty)$ that sharply

Part III: Inverse scattering of Alfvén waves in three dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamics,math.AP,['math.AP'],[arxiv.Result.Author('Mengni Li')],"The purpose of this paper is to solve the inverse scattering problem of
nonlinear Alfv\'en waves governed by the three dimensional ideal incompressible
MHD system. Bridging together geometric methods and weighted energy estimates,
we establish a couple of scattering isomorphisms to substantially strengthen
our previous rigidity results. This answer is consistent with the physical
intuition that Alfv\'en waves behave exactly in the same manner as their
scattering fields detected by the faraway observers. The novelty of the present
work is twofold: for one thing, the relationship between Alfv\'en waves
emanating from the plasma and their scattering fields at infinities is explored
to the best; for another thing, the null structure inherent in MHD equations is
thoroughly examined, especially when we estimate the pressure term.",-0.011007655,0.22260445,0.049330242,B

be of use for further study of ﬂuid models.","Moreover, because the Mikado ﬂows used as the present spatial
building blocks are not concentrated, the proof in the current compressible situation is diﬀerent from that

Navier-Stokes equations (CNS) under general pressure laws in all dimensions
$d\geq 2$. For all hypo-viscosities $(-\Delta)^\alpha$ with $\alpha\in (0,1)$,
we prove that there exist infinitely many weak solutions with the same initial
data. This provides the first non-uniqueness result of weak solutions to
viscous compressible fluid. Our proof features new constructions of building
blocks for both the density and momentum, which respect the compressible
structure. It also applies to the compressible Euler equations and the
hypo-viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INS). In particular, in
view of the Lady\v{z}enskaja-Prodi-Serrin criteria, the obtained non-uniqueness
of $L^2_tC_x$ weak solutions to the hypo-viscous INS is sharp, and reveals that
$\alpha =1$ is the sharp viscosity threshold for the well-posedness in
$L^2_tC_x$. Furthermore, we prove that the H\""older continuous weak solutions
to the compressible Euler equations may be obtained as a strong vanishing
viscosity limit of a sequence of weak solutions to the hypo-viscous CNS.",0.41982353,-0.0066686627,0.025800139,A
