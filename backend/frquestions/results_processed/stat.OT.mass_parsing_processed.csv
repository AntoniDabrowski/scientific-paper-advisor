introductory teaching and learning: formula or tidyverse. One lab was conducted

section appeared to watch a larger proportion of pre-lab YouTube videos, but
spend less time computing on RStudio Cloud. Conversely, the tidyverse section
watched a smaller proportion of the videos and spent more time on RStudio
Cloud. Analysis of lab materials showed that tidyverse labs tended to be
slightly longer (in terms of lines in the provided RMarkdown materials, as well
as minutes of the associated YouTube videos), and the tidyverse labs exposed
students to more distinct R functions. However, both labs relied on a quite
small vocabulary of consistent functions. Analysis of pre- and post-survey data
show no differences between the two labs, so students appeared to have a
positive experience regardless of section. This work provides additional
evidence for instructors looking to choose between syntaxes for introductory

decisions, and mathematical modelling is an aid to its detailed understanding.
Bias in opinion update about the value of a parameter is modelled here assuming
that observations are discounted depending on their distance from prior
opinion. The models allow belief persistence, attitude polarization, and the
irrational primacy effect to be explored. A general framework for exploring
large-sample properties of these models is given, and an attempt made to
classify the models. An interesting result is that in some models the influence
of an observation always increases with distance from the prior opinion,
whereas in others observations greatly at odds with prior opinion are given
very little weight. The models could be useful to those exploring these
phenomena in detail.",0.60288095,0.03241866,0.19890988,B_centroid

evacuation, the spatial relationship between safety evacuation signs and
evacuees will affect the response time of evacuees and the evacuation
efficiency. This paper takes 2 kinds of common safety evacuation signs,
hangtag-type and embedded, as the research object and designs space direction
information transmission efficiency and capability simulation experiment and
fire drill, the efficiency and capability of spatial direction information
transmission of safety evacuation signs are studied. The results show that the
space angle of the hangtag-type safety evacuation sign is inversely
proportional to the information transmission efficiency and capability of the
space direction, and the fire drill also confirms this conclusion. When the
spatial angle of the embedded safety evacuation sign is 5{\deg}, the spatial
direction information transmission efficiency and capability increase.
Simultaneously, the average escape time of the participants in the fire drill
was lower, and the percentage of choosing unfamiliarity exports increased. The
evolution of spatial angle has no significant effect on the intention of the
response of subjects of different genders; when choosing the direction, males
are more easily affected by the change of spatial angle than females; the
confidence level of females' choice is more easily affected by spatial angle.
In addition, according to the research results, the corresponding
three-dimensional structure safety evacuation signs are designed. The
functional structure of the safety evacuation signs is perfected, which can
effectively improve the efficiency of fire emergency evacuation.",0.6731847,-0.34442955,-0.42935136,B

work contributes to the growing literature on assessing and improving people's

personal lives. We consider the measurement of contextualized statistics
literacy - statistical literacy as applied to relevant contexts. We discuss the
development of an isomorphic instrument modifying an existing assessment,
design of a pilot study, and results which conclude that 1) the isomorphic
assessment has comparable psychometric properties, and 2) test takers have
lower statistical literacy scores on an assessment that incorporates relevant

Baumer'), arxiv.Result.Author('Nicholas J. Horton')]","A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a
public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935
public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering
bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science
instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the
relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple
student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined
transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a
growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a
disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer
pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course
in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific
computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab
sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain
requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course
mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula
across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions,
and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are
critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are
able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.",-0.13200548,-0.25987178,0.7236258,A
