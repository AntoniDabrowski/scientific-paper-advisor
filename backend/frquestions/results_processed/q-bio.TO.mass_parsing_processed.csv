Bosque'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gabriel F. Calvo'), arxiv.Result.Author('María Cruz Navarro')]","Microscale oxygenation plays a prominent role in tumour progression.
Spatiotemporal variability of oxygen distribution in the tumour
microenvironment contributes to cellular heterogeneity and to the emergence of
normoxic and hypoxic populations. Local levels of oxygen strongly affect the
response of tumours to the administration of different therapeutic modalities
and, more generally, to the phenomenon of resistance to treatments. Several
interventions have been proposed to improve tumour oxygenation, being the
elevation of the local temperature (hyperthermia) an important one. While other
factors such as the metabolic activity have to be considered, the proficiency
of the tumour vascular system is a key factor both for the tissue oxygenation
and for its temperature maps. Consequently, the interplay of these factors has
attracted considerable attention from the mathematical modelling perspective.
Here we put forward a transport-based system of partial differential equations
aimed at describing the dynamics of healthy and tumour cell subpopulations at
the microscale in a region placed between two blood vessels. By using this
model with diverse flow conditions, we analyse the oxygen and temperature
profiles that arise in different scenarios of vascular status, both during free
progression and under thermal therapy. We find that low oxygen levels are
associated to elevations of temperature in locations preferentially populated
by hypoxic cells, and hyperthermia-induced cell death, being strongly dependent
on blood flow, would only appear under highly disrupted conditions of the local
vasculature. This results in a noticeable effect of heat on hypoxic cells.
Additionally, when pronounced cell death occurs, it is followed by a
significant increase in the oxygen levels.",-0.18089841,-0.17396629,-0.508249,C_centroid

non-invasive assessment of tissue properties. Learning-based approaches can map
$T_{1\rho}$ from a reduced number of $T_{1\rho}$ weighted images, but requires
significant amounts of high quality training data. Moreover, existing methods
do not provide the confidence level of the $T_{1\rho}$ estimation. To address
these problems, we proposed a self-supervised learning neural network that
learns a $T_{1\rho}$ mapping using the relaxation constraint in the learning
process. Epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty are modelled for the
$T_{1\rho}$ quantification network to provide a Bayesian confidence estimation
of the $T_{1\rho}$ mapping. The uncertainty estimation can also regularize the
model to prevent it from learning imperfect data. We conducted experiments on
$T_{1\rho}$ data collected from 52 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease. The results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods
for $T_{1\rho}$ quantification of the liver using as few as two

of modelling the confidence of the self-supervised learning based $T_{1\rho}$

resulting in destructive tissue damage and incomplete tissue repair. Scar
formation is generally considered as a barrier for regeneration in central
nervous system (CNS), while the intrinsic mechanism of scar-forming after

cholesterol hemostasis in spinal cord lesions and injured peripheral nerves
using confocal reflection microscopy and real-time PCR analyses. The
involvement of the proteins, which were predicted to promote cholesterol efflux
in spinal cord lesions, were assessed with Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist and
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) deficiency. The role of reverse cholesterol transport
(RCT) in cholesterol clearance was examined in APOE KO mice injured sciatic
nerves and myelin-overloaded macrophages in vitro. Finally, we determined the
consequence of excess cholesterol accumulation in CNS by transplantation of
myelin into neonatal spinal cord lesions. Results: We found that excess
cholesterol accumulates in phagocytes and is inefficiently removed in spinal
cord lesions in young-adult mice. Interestingly, we observed that excessive
cholesterol also accumulates in injured peripheral nerves, but is subsequently
removed by RCT. Meanwhile, preventing RCT led to macrophage accumulation and
fibrosis in injured peripheral nerves. Furthermore, the neonatal mouse spinal
cord lesions are devoid of myelin-derived lipids, and able to heal without
excess cholesterol accumulation. We found that transplantation of myelin into
neonatal lesions disrupts healing with excessive cholesterol accumulation,
persistent macrophage activation and fibrosis, indicating myelin-derived

to enhance the performance in a speckle tracking algorithm but a correlation
