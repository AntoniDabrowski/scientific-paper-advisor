347,An interesting question is to further study the interplay of privacy and deletion-compliance.,"Under our new
deﬁnition, a data collector is able to prove that it has forgotten the deletion requester’s data
by showing that its state is consistent with having only interacted with the other users of
the system.","For example, if a protocol π is private even against a malicious data collector for some appro-
priate notion of privacy, then does that imply that any data collector is deletion-compliant
when deletion requesters interact through π?",2022-01-10 17:55:29+00:00,Deletion-Compliance in the Absence of Privacy,cs.CR,['cs.CR'],"[arxiv.Result.Author('Jonathan Godin'), arxiv.Result.Author('Philippe Lamontagne')]","Garg, Goldwasser and Vasudevan (Eurocrypt 2020) invented the notion of
deletion-compliance to formally model the ""right to be forgotten"", a concept
that confers individuals more control over their digital data. A requirement of
deletion-compliance is strong privacy for the deletion requesters since no
outside observer must be able to tell if deleted data was ever present in the
first place. Naturally, many real world systems where information can flow
across users are automatically ruled out.
  The main thesis of this paper is that deletion-compliance is a standalone
notion, distinct from privacy. We present an alternative definition that
meaningfully captures deletion-compliance without any privacy implications.
This allows broader class of data collectors to demonstrate compliance to
deletion requests and to be paired with various notions of privacy. Our new
definition has several appealing properties:
  - It is implied by the stronger definition of Garg et al. under natural
conditions, and is equivalent when we add a privacy requirement.
  - It is naturally composable with minimal assumptions.
  - Its requirements are met by data structure implementations that do not

direction over the last few years. We analyze around 75 blockchain-based
security schemes for vehicular networks from an application, security, and
blockchain perspective. The application perspective focuses on various
applications which use secure blockchain-based vehicular networks such as
transportation, parking, data sharing/ trading, and resource sharing. The
security perspective focuses on security requirements and attacks. The
blockchain perspective focuses on blockchain platforms, blockchain types, and
consensus mechanisms used in blockchain implementation. We also compile the
popular simulation tools used for simulating blockchain and for simulating
vehicular networks. Additionally, to give the readers a broader perspective of

security of our software systems. However, the manual detection of software
vulnerabilities requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming, and must be
supported by automated techniques. Objective: Such automated vulnerability
detection techniques should achieve a high accuracy, point developers directly
to the vulnerable code fragments, scale to real-world software, generalize
across the boundaries of a specific software project, and require no or only
moderate setup or configuration effort. Method: In this article, we present
VUDENC (Vulnerability Detection with Deep Learning on a Natural Codebase), a
deep learning-based vulnerability detection tool that automatically learns
features of vulnerable code from a large and real-world Python codebase. VUDENC
applies a word2vec model to identify semantically similar code tokens and to
provide a vector representation. A network of long-short-term memory cells
(LSTM) is then used to classify vulnerable code token sequences at a
fine-grained level, highlight the specific areas in the source code that are
likely to contain vulnerabilities, and provide confidence levels for its
predictions. Results: To evaluate VUDENC, we used 1,009 vulnerability-fixing
commits from different GitHub repositories that contain seven different types
of vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, Command injection, XSRF, Remote code
execution, Path disclosure, Open redirect) for training. In the experimental
evaluation, VUDENC achieves a recall of 78%-87%, a precision of 82%-96%, and an
F1 score of 80%-90%. VUDENC's code, the datasets for the vulnerabilities, and

zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled
blockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a
so-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among
a set of $k$ other users.
  In reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we
find through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We
propose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that
an adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94%
(108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
mixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest
a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify
105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial
funds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking
centralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks).
  State-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing
DeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining'' (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer
users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the
claims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving
the quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract
privacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.",-0.11080904,0.18074557,0.06476241,A

represent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains)
related to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a
multi-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the
multiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical
representation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a
block classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan
blocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key
probabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law
of large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of
blockchain, and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through
applying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation
experiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate
computation approaches developed, such as the key probabilities, the long-term
growth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the
multiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a
powerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish

processing graph domain information. GNNs have recently become a widely used
graph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representations
for complex graph data. However, due to privacy concerns and regulation
restrictions, centralized GNNs can be difficult to apply to data-sensitive
scenarios. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed for
privacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared global
model collaboratively. Although several research works have applied FL to train
GNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoor
attacks.
  This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks in
Federated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoor
attacks (DBA). Our experiments show that the DBA attack success rate is higher
than CBA in almost all evaluated cases. For CBA, the attack success rate of all
local triggers is similar to the global trigger even if the training set of the
adversarial party is embedded with the global trigger. To further explore the
properties of two backdoor attacks in Federated GNNs, we evaluate the attack
performance for a different number of clients, trigger sizes, poisoning
intensities, and trigger densities. Moreover, we explore the robustness of DBA
and CBA against two defenses. We find that both attacks are robust against the
investigated defenses, necessitating the need to consider backdoor attacks in
Federated GNNs as a novel threat that requires custom defenses.",-0.076689035,-0.26766178,-0.20826866,B

of tightly integrated computing, communication and control technologies. While
being very flexible environments, they are vulnerable to computing and
networking attacks. Recent NCSs hacking incidents had major impact. They call
for more research on cyber-physical security. Fears about the use of quantum
computing to break current cryptosystems make matters worse. While the quantum
threat motivated the creation of new disciplines to handle the issue, such as
post-quantum cryptography, other fields have overlooked the existence of
quantum-enabled adversaries. This is the case of cyber-physical defense
research, a distinct but complementary discipline to cyber-physical protection.
Cyber-physical defense refers to the capability to detect and react in response
to cyber-physical attacks. Concretely, it involves the integration of
mechanisms to identify adverse events and prepare response plans, during and
after incidents occur. In this paper, we make the assumption that the
eventually available quantum computer will provide an advantage to adversaries
against defenders, unless they also adopt this technology. We envision the
necessity for a paradigm shift, where an increase of adversarial resources
because of quantum supremacy does not translate into higher likelihood of
disruptions. Consistently with current system design practices in other areas,
such as the use of artificial intelligence for the reinforcement of attack
detection tools, we outline a vision for next generation cyber-physical defense
layers leveraging ideas from quantum computing and machine learning. Through an
example, we show that defenders of NCSs can learn and improve their strategies

This connectivity complicates the computation of individual privacy loss in
differentially private learning. The problem is exacerbated by an absence of a

extends to the domain of GNNs, rendering private machine learning on

delta)-differential privacy, with the numerical estimation of differential
privacy parameters. These conditions can be applied to analyze the differential
privacy properties for the discrete noise adding mechanisms with various kinds
of noises. Then, with the differential privacy guarantees, we propose an
optimal discrete epsilon-differential private noise adding mechanism under the
utility-maximization framework, where the utility is characterized by the
similarity of the statistical properties between the mechanism's input and
output. For this setup, we find that the class of the discrete noise
probability distributions in the optimal mechanism is Staircase-shaped.",0.2625614,0.045032978,-0.18900695,B

effect produced by users performing teeth gestures for earable authentication.
In particular, we design representative teeth gestures that can produce
effective sonic waves carrying the information of the toothprint. To reliably
capture the acoustic toothprint, it leverages the occlusion effect of the ear
canal and the inward-facing microphone of the earables. It then extracts
multi-level acoustic features to reflect the intrinsic toothprint information
for authentication. The key advantages of ToothSonic are that it is suitable
for earables and is resistant to various spoofing attacks as the acoustic
toothprint is captured via the user's private teeth-ear channel that modulates
and encrypts the sonic waves. Our experiment studies with 25 participants show
that ToothSonic achieves up to 95% accuracy with only one of the users' tooth
gestures.",0.25252512,-0.16370454,0.15668236,B

reliance on untrusted third-party Intellectual Properties (IPs), CAD tools, and
design facilities, hardware Trojan attacks have become a serious threat to the
semiconductor industry. Development of effective countermeasures against
hardware Trojan attacks requires: (1) fast and reliable exploration of the
viable Trojan attack space for a given design and (2) a suite of high-quality
Trojan-inserted benchmarks that meet specific standards. The latter has become
essential for the development and evaluation of design/verification solutions
to achieve quantifiable assurance against Trojan attacks. While existing static
benchmarks provide a baseline for comparing different countermeasures, they
only enumerate a limited number of handcrafted Trojans from the complete Trojan
design space. To accomplish these dual objectives, in this paper, we present
MIMIC, a novel AI-guided framework for automatic Trojan insertion, which can
create a large population of valid Trojans for a given design by mimicking the
properties of a small set of known Trojans. While there exist tools to
automatically insert Trojan instances using fixed Trojan templates, they cannot
analyze known Trojan attacks for creating new instances that accurately capture
the threat model. MIMIC works in two major steps: (1) it analyzes structural
and functional features of existing Trojan populations in a multi-dimensional
space to train machine learning models and generate a large number of ""virtual
Trojans"" of the given design, (2) next, it binds them into the design by
matching their functional/structural properties with suitable nets of the
internal logic structure. We have developed a complete tool flow for MIMIC,
extensively evaluated the framework by exploring several use-cases, and
quantified its effectiveness to demonstrate highly promising results.",0.20291227,-0.2644754,-0.16370921,B

patients in need for a replacement organ with compatible living donors. Ideally
many medical institutions should participate in a matching program to increase
the chance for successful matches. However, to fulfill legal requirements
current systems use complicated policy-based data protection mechanisms that
effectively exclude smaller medical facilities to participate. Employing secure
multi-party computation (MPC) techniques provides a technical way to satisfy
data protection requirements for highly sensitive personal health information
while simultaneously reducing the regulatory burdens.
  Results: We have designed, implemented, and benchmarked SPIKE, a secure
MPC-based privacy-preserving KEP which computes a solution by finding matching
donor-recipient pairs in a graph structure. SPIKE matches 40 pairs in cycles of
length 2 in less than 4 minutes and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
protocol by a factor of 400x in runtime while providing medically more robust
solutions.
  Conclusions: We show how to solve the KEP in a robust and privacy-preserving
manner achieving practical performance. The usage of MPC techniques fulfills
many data protection requirements on a technical level, allowing smaller health
care providers to directly participate in a kidney exchange with reduced legal

  We design and construct a so-called {\em Interactive Server Memory Resource}

client-server protocol in CC, namely the Server Memory Resource. We then apply
our ISMR construction to two types of interactive cryptographic protocols for
remote storage : Updatable Encryption (UE) and Private Information Retrieval
(PIR).
  Concerning UE, our results are a composable version of those protocols,
clarifying the security guarantees achieved by {\em any} UE scheme. Namely, we
give the relevant security notion to consider according to a given leakage
context. Letting USMR denote our ISMR adapted to the UE application, we prove
that $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}\mathsf{UE}\text{-}\mathsf{CPA}$ security is
sufficient for a secure construction of a confidential USMR that hides the age
of ciphertexts; and
$\mathsf{IND}\text{-}(\mathsf{ENC}+\mathsf{UPD})\text{-}\mathsf{CPA}$ security
is sufficient for a secure construction of a confidential USMR in case of
unrestricted leakage. As a consequence, contrary to what was claimed before,
the $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}\mathsf{UE}$ security notion is not always stronger
than the $\mathsf{IND}\text{-}(\mathsf{ENC+UPD})$ one.
  Concerning PIR, we also give a composable version of PIR protocols, yielding
a unique model that unifies different notions of PIR : IT-PIR, C-PIR, one- or

the final estimate by the data curator.
  In this work, we further advance this knowledge by proposing a new
fine-grained attack, which allows the attacker to fine-tune and simultaneously
manipulate mean and variance estimations that are popular analytical tasks for
many real-world applications. To accomplish this goal, the attack leverages the
characteristics of LDP to inject fake data into the output domain of the local
LDP instance. We call our attack the output poisoning attack (OPA). we
surprisingly observe a security-privacy consistency where a small privacy loss
enhances the security of LDP, which contradicts with the known security-privacy
trade-off from prior work. We further study this consistency and reveal a more

comprehensively evaluate our attack against a baseline attack that intuitively

protect privacy, it is an attractive choice to compute only with ciphertext in

the current IoT ecosystem. Research has found that IoT malware can spread
quickly on devices of different processer architectures, which leads our
attention to cross-architecture binary similarity comparison technology. The
goal of binary similarity comparison is to determine whether the semantics of
two binary snippets is similar. Existing learning-based approaches usually
learn the representations of binary code snippets individually and perform
similarity matching based on the distance metric, without considering
inter-binary semantic interactions. Moreover, they often rely on the
large-scale external code corpus for instruction embeddings pre-training, which
is heavyweight and easy to suffer the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. In this
paper, we propose an interaction-based cross-architecture IoT binary similarity
comparison system, Inter-BIN. Our key insight is to introduce interaction
between instruction sequences by co-attention mechanism, which can flexibly
perform soft alignment of semantically related instructions from different
architectures. And we design a lightweight multi-feature fusion-based
instruction embedding method, which can avoid the heavy workload and the OOV
problem of previous approaches. Extensive experiments show that Inter-BIN can
significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on cross-architecture
binary similarity comparison tasks of different input granularities.
Furthermore, we present an IoT malware function matching dataset from real
network environments, CrossMal, containing 1,878,437 cross-architecture reuse

propose to study and design saturating counters from the defense perspective of
differential privacy, so that attackers cannot distinguish the states that
saturating counters are in and further infer sensitive information. To obtain
theoretical guarantees, we use Markov chain to formalize the attack algorithm
applied to the saturating counter, investigate into the optimal attack strategy

the attacker is able to accurately guess the branch execution of the victim's
process in the existing saturating counters. To avoid this, we design a new
probabilistic saturating counter, which generalizes the existing conventional

applied to deduce parameters of the new saturating counters so that the
security requirement can be satisfied. We also theoretically calculate the
misprediction rate when the saturating counter reaches the steady state. The
experimental results on testing programs show that the calculated theoretical
results agree with the experimental performances. Compared with the existing

encoder-decoder architecture enhanced with a special transformation layer. The
attack can model a wide range of existing pervasive backdoor attacks and
quantify them by class distances. As such, using the samples derived from our
attack in adversarial training can harden a model against these backdoor
vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on 9 datasets with 15 model structures shows
that our technique can enlarge class distances by 59.65% on average with less
than 1% accuracy degradation and no robustness loss, outperforming five
hardening techniques such as adversarial training, universal adversarial
training, MOTH, etc. It can reduce the attack success rate of six pervasive

financial properties but also technical aspects. Existing synthesis work for
DeFi tends to ignore the relevance of various layers of security for the whole

widespread use of many types of mobile devices in indoor environments have
resulted in generating a massive amount of people's location data. While
geo-spatial data contains sensitive information about personal activities,
collecting it in its raw form may lead to the leak of personal information
relating to the people, violating their privacy. This paper proposes a novel
privacy-aware framework for aggregating the indoor location data employing the
Local Differential Privacy (LDP) technique, in which the user location data is
changed locally in the user's device and is sent to the aggregator afterward.
Therefore, the users' locations are kept hidden from a server or any attackers.
The practical feasibility of applying the proposed framework is verified by two
real-world datasets. The impact of dataset properties, the privacy mechanisms,
and the privacy level on our framework are also investigated. The experimental
results indicate that the presented framework can protect the location
information of users, and the accuracy of the population frequency of different

deep learning (DL) models from the side-channel leakage of DL hardware
accelerators. In response, to provide side-channel leakage resiliency to DL
hardware accelerators, several approaches have been proposed, mainly borrowed
from the methodologies devised for cryptographic implementations. Therefore, as
expected, the same challenges posed by the complex design of such
countermeasures should be dealt with. This is despite the fact that fundamental
cryptographic approaches, specifically secure and private function evaluation,
could potentially improve the robustness against side-channel leakage. To
examine this and weigh the costs and benefits, we introduce hardware garbled NN
(HWGN2), a DL hardware accelerator implemented on FPGA. HWGN2 also provides NN
designers with the flexibility to protect their IP in real-time applications,
where hardware resources are heavily constrained, through a
hardware-communication cost trade-off. Concretely, we apply garbled circuits,
implemented using a MIPS architecture that achieves up to 62.5x fewer logical
and 66x less memory utilization than the state-of-the-art approaches at the
price of communication overhead. Further, the side-channel resiliency of HWGN2
is demonstrated by employing the test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) test
against both power and electromagnetic side-channels. This is in addition to
the inherent feature of HWGN2: it ensures the privacy of users' input,
including the architecture of NNs. We also demonstrate a natural extension to

and security concerns. In response to these privacy risks, many browser vendors
have deployed DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to encrypt queries between users and DNS
resolvers. Today, many client-side deployments of DoH, particularly in
browsers, select between only a few resolvers, despite the fact that many more
encrypted DNS resolvers are deployed in practice. Unfortunately, if users only
have a few choices of encrypted resolver, and only a few perform well from any
particular vantage point, then the privacy problems that DoH was deployed to
help address merely shift to a different set of third parties. It is thus
important to assess the performance characteristics of more encrypted DNS
resolvers, to determine how many options for encrypted DNS resolvers users tend
to have in practice. In this paper, we explore the performance of a large group
of encrypted DNS resolvers supporting DoH by measuring DNS query response times
from global vantage points in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our results show
that many non-mainstream resolvers have higher response times than mainstream
resolvers, particularly for non-mainstream resolvers that are queried from more
distant vantage points -- suggesting that most encrypted DNS resolvers are not
replicated or anycast. In some cases, however, certain non-mainstream resolvers
perform at least as well as mainstream resolvers, suggesting that users may be
able to use a broader set of encrypted DNS resolvers than those that are

This problem can also be seen as a structured version of MinRank, which is
ubiquitous in multivariate cryptography. Recently, \cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20}
proposed attacks based on two new algebraic modelings, namely the MaxMinors
modeling which is specific to RD and the Support-Minors modeling which applies
to MinRank in general. Both improved significantly the complexity of algebraic
attacks on these two problems. In the case of RD and contrarily to what was
believed up to now, these new attacks were shown to be able to outperform
combinatorial attacks and this even for very small field sizes.
  However, we prove here that the analysis performed in \cite{BBCGPSTV20} for
one of these attacks which consists in mixing the MaxMinors modeling with the
Support-Minors modeling to solve RD is too optimistic and leads to
underestimate the overall complexity. This is done by exhibiting linear
dependencies between these equations and by considering an $\fqm$ version of
these modelings which turns out to be instrumental for getting a better
understanding of both systems. Moreover, by working over $\Fqm$ rather than
over $\ff{q}$, we are able to drastically reduce the number of variables in the
system and we (i) still keep enough algebraic equations to be able to solve the
system, (ii) are able to analyze rigorously the complexity of our approach.
This new approach may improve the older MaxMinors approach on RD from
\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20} for certain parameters. We also introduce a new
hybrid approach on the Support-Minors system whose impact is much more general
since it applies to any MinRank problem. This technique improves significantly

sizes.",0.078913055,0.119077176,-0.32298246,A

protocol as secure and stable as miners are incentivised to follow the
behaviour of the majority. However, whether some strategic mining behaviours
occur in practice is still a major concern. In this paper we target this
question by focusing on a security threat: a selfish mining attack in which
malicious miners deviate from protocol by not immediately revealing their newly
mined blocks. We propose a statistical test to analyse each miner's behaviour
in five popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monacoin, Ethereum and
Bitcoin Cash. Our method is based on the realisation that selfish mining
behaviour will cause identifiable anomalies in the statistics of miner's
successive blocks discovery. Secondly, we apply heuristics-based address
clustering to improve the detectability of this kind of behaviour. We find a
marked presence of abnormal miners in Monacoin and Bitcoin Cash, and, to a
lesser extent, in Ethereum. Finally, we extend our method to detect coordinated
selfish mining attacks, finding mining cartels in Monacoin where miners might
secretly share information about newly mined blocks in advance. Our analysis
contributes to the research on security in cryptocurrency systems by providing
the first empirical evidence that the aforementioned strategic mining

a malware classifier, more than a billion samples can easily accumulate. Given
the scale of the problem, sequential training using continual learning
techniques could provide substantial benefits in reducing training and storage
overhead. To date, however, there has been no exploration of CL applied to
malware classification tasks. In this paper, we study 11 CL techniques applied
to three malware tasks covering common incremental learning scenarios,
including task, class, and domain incremental learning (IL). Specifically,
using two realistic, large-scale malware datasets, we evaluate the performance
of the CL methods on both binary malware classification (Domain-IL) and
multi-class malware family classification (Task-IL and Class-IL) tasks. To our
surprise, continual learning methods significantly underperformed naive Joint
replay of the training data in nearly all settings -- in some cases reducing
accuracy by more than 70 percentage points. A simple approach of selectively
replaying 20% of the stored data achieves better performance, with 50% of the

There are a few ways to answer this
question. 1. It is useful to have cryptosystems that are based on a variety of
hard computational problems so the different cryptosystems are not all
vulnerable in the same way. 2. The computational aspects of lattice-based
cryptosystem are usually simple to understand and fairly easy to implement in
practice. 3. Lattice-based cryptosystems have lower encryption/decryption
computational complexities compared to popular cryptosystems that are based on
the integer factorisation or the discrete logarithm problems. 4. Lattice-based
cryptosystems enjoy strong worst-case hardness security proofs based on
approximate versions of known NP-hard lattice problems. 5. Lattice-based
cryptosystems are believed to be good candidates for post-quantum cryptography,
since there are currently no known quantum algorithms for solving lattice
problems that perform significantly better than the best-known classical
(non-quantum) algorithms, unlike for integer factorisation and (elliptic curve)
discrete logarithm problems. 6. Last but not least, interesting structures in
lattice problems have led to significant advances in Homomorphic Encryption, a
new research area with wide-ranging applications.",0.24872273,0.10204078,-0.28446642,A

approach, however, needs domain-specific knowledge and expertise that are
difficult to duplicate. This paper compares various deep learning-based
password guessing approaches that do not require domain knowledge or

vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to infer
whether an input sample was used to train the model. Over the past few years,
researchers have produced many membership inference attacks and defenses.
However, these attacks and defenses employ a variety of strategies and are
conducted in different models and datasets. The lack of comprehensive
benchmark, however, means we do not understand the strengths and weaknesses of
existing attacks and defenses.
  We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale measurement of different
membership inference attacks and defenses. We systematize membership inference
through the study of nine attacks and six defenses and measure the performance
of different attacks and defenses in the holistic evaluation. We then quantify
the impact of the threat model on the results of these attacks. We find that
some assumptions of the threat model, such as same-architecture and
same-distribution between shadow and target models, are unnecessary. We are
also the first to execute attacks on the real-world data collected from the
Internet, instead of laboratory datasets. We further investigate what
determines the performance of membership inference attacks and reveal that the
commonly believed overfitting level is not sufficient for the success of the
attacks. Instead, the Jensen-Shannon distance of entropy/cross-entropy between
member and non-member samples correlates with attack performance much better.
This gives us a new way to accurately predict membership inference risks
without running the attack. Finally, we find that data augmentation degrades
the performance of existing attacks to a larger extent, and we propose an
adaptive attack using augmentation to train shadow and attack models that
improve attack performance.",-0.021850413,-0.32573146,-0.054355793,B

various performance optimization techniques in modern processors, such as
speculative execution, branch prediction, and chaotic execution. Both now and
in the future, these optimization techniques are critical for improving the
execution speed of processor instructions. However, researchers have discovered
that these techniques introduce hidden inherent security flaws, such as
meltdown and ghost attacks in recent years. They exploit techniques such as
chaotic execution or speculative execution combined with cache-based
side-channel attacks to leak protected data. The impact of these
vulnerabilities is enormous because they are prevalent in existing or future
processors. However, until today, meltdown and ghost have not been effectively
addressed, but instead, multiple attack variants and different attack
implementations have evolved from them. This paper proposes to optimize four
different hardware performance events through feature selection and use machine
learning algorithms to build a real-time detection mechanism for Spectre
v1,v2,v4, and different implementations of meltdown attacks, ultimately
achieving an accuracy rate of over 99\%. In order to verify the practicality of
the attack detection model, this paper is tested with a variety of benign

shown great promise to revolutionize finance and commerce. Although they are
gaining increasing popularity, they face technical challenges when it comes to
scaling to support greater demand while maintaining their desirable security
properties. In an exciting line of recent work, many researchers have proposed
various scalable blockchain protocols that demonstrate the potential to solve
these challenges. However, many of these protocols come with the assumptions of
honest majority and symmetric network access which may not accurately reflect
the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational.
Secondly, these works show that their protocol works in an ideal environment
where each party has equal access to the network whereas different parties have
varying latencies and network speeds. These assumptions may render the
protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by
the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols.
  We propose a scalable blockchain protocol, Interlude, which comes with the
typical security guarantees while focusing on game-theoretic soundness and
network fairness. The novelty of Interlude is that it has a relatively simple
design consisting of a sequence of parallel blocks containing disjoint
transaction sets that can be mined quickly followed by a series block that is
slow to mine and gives the honest parties in the network time to synchronize.
Thus, between the chaos of parallel blocks, our blockchain protocol masquerades

Based on the study results, we believe that Thermanator Attacks represent a new credible threat for password-based
systems, and that human-induced thermal side-channels deserve further study.","In particular, it exposes the vulnerability of standard password-based
systems to adversarial collection of thermal emanations.","This is especially true considering
constantly decreasing costs and increasing availability of high-quality thermal imagers.",2022-10-05 13:13:17+00:00,Thermal (and Hybrid Thermal/Audio) Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboard Input,cs.CR,"['cs.CR', 'cs.LG']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Tyler Kaczmarek'), arxiv.Result.Author('Ercan Ozturk'), arxiv.Result.Author('Pier Paolo Tricomi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Gene Tsudik')]","To date, there has been no systematic investigation of thermal profiles of
keyboards, and thus no efforts have been made to secure them. This serves as
our main motivation for constructing a means for password harvesting from
keyboard thermal emanations. Specifically, we introduce Thermanator: a new
post-factum insider attack based on heat transfer caused by a user typing a
password on a typical external (plastic) keyboard.
  We conduct and describe a user study that collected thermal residues from 30
users entering 10 unique passwords (both weak and strong) on 4 popular
commodity keyboards. Results show that entire sets of key-presses can be
recovered by non-expert users as late as 30 seconds after initial password
entry, while partial sets can be recovered as late as 1 minute after entry.
However, the thermal residue side-channel lacks information about password
length, duplicate key-presses, and key-press ordering. To overcome these
limitations, we leverage keyboard acoustic emanations and combine the two to
yield AcuTherm, the first hybrid side-channel attack on keyboards. AcuTherm
significantly reduces password search without the need for any training on the
victim's typing. We report results gathered for many representative passwords
based on a user study involving 19 subjects.
  The takeaway of this work is three-fold: (1) using plastic keyboards to enter
secrets (such as passwords and PINs) is even less secure than previously
recognized, (2) post-factum thermal imaging attacks are realistic, and (3)
hybrid (multiple side-channel) attacks are both realistic and effective.",-0.24402532,-0.05752881,-0.12694225,C

platforms have increased the call for decentralized solutions. However,
retrieving and querying data in more decentralized environments requires
fundamentally different approaches, whose properties are not yet well
understood. Link Traversal-based Query Processing (LTQP) is a technique for
querying over decentralized data networks, in which a client-side query engine
discovers data by traversing links between documents. Since decentralized
environments are potentially unsafe due to their non-centrally controlled
nature, there is a need for client-side LTQP query engines to be resistant
against security threats aimed at the query engine's host machine or the query
initiator's personal data. As such, we have performed an analysis of potential
security vulnerabilities of LTQP. This article provides an overview of security
threats in related domains, which are used as inspiration for the
identification of 10 LTQP security threats. Each threat is explained, together
with an example, and one or more avenues for mitigations are proposed. We
conclude with several concrete recommendations for LTQP query engine developers
and data publishers as a first step to mitigate some of these issues. With this
work, we start filling the unknowns for enabling querying over decentralized
environments. Aside from future work on security, wider research is needed to
uncover missing building blocks for enabling true decentralization.",-0.078454584,0.13561226,-0.18438552,A

energy resource (DER) systems has increased the surface of possible
cyber-physical attacks. Attacks originating from the distributed edge devices
of DER system, such as photovoltaic (PV) system, is often difficult to detect.
An attacker may change the control configurations or various setpoints of the
PV inverters to destabilize the power grid, damage devices, or for the purpose
of economic gain. A more powerful attacker may even manipulate the PV system
metering data transmitted for remote monitoring, so that (s)he can remain
hidden. In this paper, we consider a case where PV systems operating in
different control modes can be simultaneously attacked and the attacker has the
ability to manipulate individual PV bus measurements to avoid detection. We
show that even in such a scenario, with just the aggregated measurements (that
the attacker cannot manipulate), machine learning (ML) techniques are able to
detect the attack in a fast and accurate manner. We use a standard radial
distribution network, together with real smart home electricity consumption
data and solar power data in our experimental setup. We test the performance of
several ML algorithms to detect attacks on the PV system. Our detailed

external suppliers are increasingly used. However, incorporating external data
poses data poisoning risks, wherein attackers manipulate their data to degrade
model utility or integrity. Most poisoning defenses presume access to a set of
clean data (or base set). While this assumption has been taken for granted,
given the fast-growing research on stealthy poisoning attacks, a question
arises: can defenders really identify a clean subset within a contaminated
dataset to support defenses?
  This paper starts by examining the impact of poisoned samples on defenses
when they are mistakenly mixed into the base set. We analyze five defenses and
find that their performance deteriorates dramatically with less than 1%
poisoned points in the base set. These findings suggest that sifting out a base
set with high precision is key to these defenses' performance. Motivated by
these observations, we study how precise existing automated tools and human
inspection are at identifying clean data in the presence of data poisoning.
Unfortunately, neither effort achieves the precision needed. Worse yet, many of
the outcomes are worse than random selection.
  In addition to uncovering the challenge, we propose a practical
countermeasure, Meta-Sift. Our method is based on the insight that existing
attacks' poisoned samples shifts from clean data distributions. Hence, training
on the clean portion of a dataset and testing on the corrupted portion will
result in high prediction loss. Leveraging the insight, we formulate a bilevel
optimization to identify clean data and further introduce a suite of techniques
to improve efficiency and precision. Our evaluation shows that Meta-Sift can
sift a clean base set with 100% precision under a wide range of poisoning
attacks. The selected base set is large enough to give rise to successful
defenses.",-0.053837948,-0.18730502,-0.12141861,C

statistically assess the efficacy of the attack (without relying on human

Specifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an extremely simple self-supervised

both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal that the representation

security governance strategies from other ecosystems to the Cargo ecosystem. To
fill the gap in this area, this paper constructs a knowledge graph of

clients poison the global model via sending malicious model updates to the
server. Existing defenses focus on preventing a small number of malicious
clients from poisoning the global model via robust federated learning methods
and detecting malicious clients when there are a large number of them. However,
it is still an open challenge how to recover the global model from poisoning
attacks after the malicious clients are detected. A naive solution is to remove
the detected malicious clients and train a new global model from scratch, which
incurs large cost that may be intolerable for resource-constrained clients such
as smartphones and IoT devices.
  In this work, we propose FedRecover, which can recover an accurate global
model from poisoning attacks with small cost for the clients. Our key idea is
that the server estimates the clients' model updates instead of asking the
clients to compute and communicate them during the recovery process. In
particular, the server stores the global models and clients' model updates in
each round, when training the poisoned global model. During the recovery
process, the server estimates a client's model update in each round using its
stored historical information. Moreover, we further optimize FedRecover to
recover a more accurate global model using warm-up, periodic correction,
abnormality fixing, and final tuning strategies, in which the server asks the
clients to compute and communicate their exact model updates. Theoretically, we
show that the global model recovered by FedRecover is close to or the same as
that recovered by train-from-scratch under some assumptions. Empirically, our
evaluation on four datasets, three federated learning methods, as well as
untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks (e.g., backdoor attacks) shows that
FedRecover is both accurate and efficient.",-0.031748697,-0.1473645,-0.17667693,B

Up to 80% of bugs in solidity source files can be fixed by less than three fix
actions. Modification is the mostly used fix action, which involves three lines
of code on average. By using the analysis tool Mythril to detect the
vulnerabilities, we find that nearly 20% of the solidity files in our dataset
had or have had vulnerabilities. We finally find that the developers may not
put much attention to fixing vulnerabilities reported by Mythril completely or

self-supervised learning to improve the label efficiency of behavioural

in supervised settings. Using two EEG datasets, we show that at lower amounts
of labelled data, non-contrastive learning performs 4%-11% more than
conventional methods such as supervised learning and data augmentation. We also
show that, in general, self-supervised learning methods perform better than

between blockchains. This interoperability promotes innovation, unlocks
liquidity and access to assets. However, blockchains are isolated systems that
originally were not designed for interoperability. This makes cross-chain
communication, or bridges for short, insecure by nature. More precisely,
cross-chain systems face security challenges in terms of selfish rational
players such as maximal extractable value (MEV) and censorship.
  We propose to solve these challenges using zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for
cross-chain communication. Securing cross-chain communication is remarkably
more complex than securing single-chain events as such a system must preserve
user security against both on- and off-chain analysis.
  To achieve this goal, we propose the following pair of contributions: the
DACT protocol and the SurferMonkey infrastructure that supports the DACT
protocol. The DACT protocol is a global solution for the anonymity and security
challenges of agnostic blockchain intercommunication. DACT breaks on- and
off-chain analysis thanks to the use of ZKPs. SurferMonkey is a decentralized
infrastructure that implements DACT in practice. Since SurferMonkey works at
the blockchain application layer, any decentralized application (dApp) can use
SurferMonkey to send any type of message to a dApp on another blockchain. With
SurferMonkey, users can neither be censored nor be exposed to MEV. By applying
decentralized proactive security, we obtain resilience against selfish rational
players, and raise the security bar against cyberattacks. We have implemented a
proof of concept (PoC) of SurferMonkey by reverse engineering Tornado Cash and
by applying IDEN3 ZKP circuits. SurferMonkey enables new usecases, ranging from
anonymous voting and gaming, to a new phase of anonymous decentralized finance

implement an attack on system availability. The target's data remains encrypted
and is held captive by the attacker until a ransom demand is met. A common
approach used by many crypto-ransomware detection techniques is to monitor file
system activity and attempt to identify encrypted files being written to disk,
often using a file's entropy as an indicator of encryption. However, often in
the description of these techniques, little or no discussion is made as to why
a particular entropy calculation technique is selected or any justification
given as to why one technique is selected over the alternatives. The Shannon
method of entropy calculation is the most commonly-used technique when it comes
to file encryption identification in crypto-ransomware detection techniques.
Overall, correctly encrypted data should be indistinguishable from random data,
so apart from the standard mathematical entropy calculations such as
Chi-Square, Shannon Entropy and Serial Correlation, the test suites used to
validate the output from pseudo-random number generators would also be suited
to perform this analysis. he hypothesis being that there is a fundamental
difference between different entropy methods and that the best methods may be
used to better detect ransomware encrypted files. The paper compares the
accuracy of 53 distinct tests in being able to differentiate between encrypted
data and other file types. The testing is broken down into two phases, the
first phase is used to identify potential candidate tests, and a second phase
where these candidates are thoroughly evaluated. To ensure that the tests were
sufficiently robust, the NapierOne dataset is used. This dataset contains
thousands of examples of the most commonly used file types, as well as examples

theoretical privacy guarantees offered in most extant studies assume learning
models from scratch through many training iterations in an asymptotic setting,

training iterations is significantly smaller. To address the gap, we present
\ewtune, a DP framework for fine-tuning LLMs based on Edgeworth accountant with

guarantees to LLM fine-tuning process, it directly contributes to decreasing

algorithms to find such twin B-smooth integers that lie in a given interval by
using the structure of solutions of the above Pell equation. The problem of

increasing B to allow for cryptographically sized solutions makes this approach
utterly infeasible. We start by revisiting the Pell solution structure of the

pairs, we focus on identifying only those that lie in a given interval. This
restriction allows us to describe algorithms that navigate the vast set of Pell
solutions in a more targeted way. Experiments run with these algorithms have
provided examples of twin B-smooth pairs that are larger and have smaller

RowHammer vulnerability that plagues modern DRAM (Dynamic Random Memory Access)
chips, which are used in almost all computing systems as main memory.
  RowHammer is the phenomenon in which repeatedly accessing a row in a real
DRAM chip causes bitflips (i.e., data corruption) in physically nearby rows.
This phenomenon leads to a serious and widespread system security
vulnerability, as many works since the original RowHammer paper in 2014 have
shown. Recent analysis of the RowHammer phenomenon reveals that the problem is
getting much worse as DRAM technology scaling continues: newer DRAM chips are
fundamentally more vulnerable to RowHammer at the device and circuit levels.
Deeper analysis of RowHammer shows that there are many dimensions to the
problem as the vulnerability is sensitive to many variables, including
environmental conditions (temperature \& voltage), process variation, stored
data patterns, as well as memory access patterns and memory control policies.
As such, it has proven difficult to devise fully-secure and very efficient
(i.e., low-overhead in performance, energy, area) protection mechanisms against
RowHammer and attempts made by DRAM manufacturers have been shown to lack
security guarantees.
  After reviewing various recent developments in exploiting, understanding, and
mitigating RowHammer, we discuss future directions that we believe are critical
for solving the RowHammer problem. We argue for two major directions to amplify
research and development efforts in: 1) building a much deeper understanding of
the problem and its many dimensions, in both cutting-edge DRAM chips and
computing systems deployed in the field, and 2) the design and development of
extremely efficient and fully-secure solutions via system-memory cooperation.",0.13839827,0.05045997,-0.25616002,A

are incorporated in the secure software development methodologies. Furthermore,
we explored methods used to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the

identification based on the source code is a well studied field, the
identification of vulnerabilities on basis of a binary executable without the

how such detection can be achieved by deep learning methods. However, that
particular approach is limited to the identification of only 4 types of
vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we analyze to what extent we could cover the
identification of a larger variety of vulnerabilities. Therefore, a supervised
deep learning approach using recurrent neural networks for the application of
vulnerability detection based on binary executables is used. The underlying
basis is a dataset with 50,651 samples of vulnerable code in the form of a
standardized LLVM Intermediate Representation. The vectorised features of a
Word2Vec model are used to train different variations of three basic
architectures of recurrent neural networks (GRU, LSTM, SRNN). A binary
classification was established for detecting the presence of an arbitrary
vulnerability, and a multi-class model was trained for the identification of
the exact vulnerability, which achieved an out-of-sample accuracy of 88% and
77%, respectively. Differences in the detection of different vulnerabilities
were also observed, with non-vulnerable samples being detected with a

overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to

reduce the size of DNNs with comparable accuracy as their floating-point

implemented energy-efficiently. Similar to their floating-point numbered

have sparked interest in efficient deep learning mechanisms, e.g., quantization
or pruning. These mechanisms enable the construction of a small, efficient
version of commercial-scale models with comparable accuracy, accelerating their
deployment to resource-constrained devices.
  In this paper, we study the security considerations of publishing on-device
variants of large-scale models. We first show that an adversary can exploit
on-device models to make attacking the large models easier. In evaluations
across 19 DNNs, by exploiting the published on-device models as a transfer
prior, the adversarial vulnerability of the original commercial-scale models
increases by up to 100x. We then show that the vulnerability increases as the
similarity between a full-scale and its efficient model increase. Based on the
insights, we propose a defense, $similarity$-$unpairing$, that fine-tunes
on-device models with the objective of reducing the similarity. We evaluated
our defense on all the 19 DNNs and found that it reduces the transferability up
to 90% and the number of queries required by a factor of 10-100x. Our results
suggest that further research is needed on the security (or even privacy)
