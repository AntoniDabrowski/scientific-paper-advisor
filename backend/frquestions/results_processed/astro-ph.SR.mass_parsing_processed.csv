having an outer orbital period from months to a few years, comprise a small,
but continuously growing group of the triple and multiple star zoo. Many of
them consist of at least one eclipsing pair of stars and, therefore, exhibit
readily observable short-term dynamical interactions among the components.
Thus, their dynamical and astrophysical properties can be explored with high
precision. In this paper we present an overview of the history of the search
for additional components around eclipsing binaries from the first
serendipitous discoveries to more systematic recent studies. We describe the
different observational detection methods and discuss their connections to the
different kinds of astrophysical and dynamical information that can be mined
from the different datasets. Moreover, the connection amongst the observable
phenomena and the long-term dynamics of such systems is also discussed.",0.1385553,-0.0069820844,-0.25184143,A

it is possible to investigate the formation of CMEs by comparing multi-CMEs
under a homologous physical condition. AR 11283 had been present on the solar
surface for several days when a bipole emerged on 2011 September 4. Its
positive polarity collided with the pre-existing negative polarity belonging to
a different bipole, producing recurrent solar activities along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) between the colliding polarities, namely the so-called
collisional PIL (cPIL). Our results show that a large amount of energy and
helicity were built up in the form of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), with
recurrent release and accumulation processes. These MFRs were built up along
the cPIL. A flux deficit method is adopted and shows that magnetic cancellation
happens along the cPIL due to the collisional shearing scenario proposed by
Chintzoglou et al. The total amount of canceled flux was
$\sim$0.7$\times$10$^{21}$ Mx with an uncertainty of $\sim$13.2$\%$ within the
confidence region of the 30$^\circ$ sun-center distance. The canceled flux
amounts to 24$\%$ of the total unsigned flux of the bipolar magnetic region.
The results show that the magnetic fields beside the cPIL are very sheared, and
the average shear angle is above 70$^\circ$ after the collision. The fast
expansion of the twist kernels of the MFRs and the continuous eruptive
activities are both driven by the collisional shearing process. These results
are important for better understanding the buildup process of the MFRs

Although the linear tidal response of the star is a series of orbital-harmonic
frequencies which are not stellar eigenfrequencies, we show that the
non-linearly excited non-orbital-harmonic TEOs are eigenmodes. By carefully
choosing the modes which satisfy the mode-coupling selection rules, a period
spacing ($\Delta P$) pattern of quadrupole gravity modes ($\Delta P \approx
2520-2535$ sec) can be discerned in the Fourier spectrum, with a detection
significance level of $99.9\%$. The inferred period spacing value agrees
remarkably well with the theoretical $l=2,m=0$ g modes from a stellar model
with the measured mass, radius and effective temperature. We also find that the
two largest-amplitude TEOs at $N=90, 91$ harmonics are very close to resonance
with $l=2,m=0$ eigenmodes, and likely come from different stars.
  Previous works on tidal oscillations primarily focus on the modeling of TEO
amplitudes and phases, the high sensitivity of TEO amplitude to the frequency
detuning (tidal forcing frequency minus the closest stellar eigenfrequency)
requires extremely dense grids of stellar models and prevents us from
constraining the stellar physical parameters easily. This work, however, opens
the window of real tidal asteroseismology by using the eigenfrequencies of the
star inferred from the non-linear TEOs and possibly very-close-to-resonance

quantity in the partially ionized plasma of the solar convection zone.
  Aims. The aim of this study is to understand the impact of heavy elements on
the $\Gamma_1$ profile. We calculated $\Gamma_1$ with the SAHA-S equation of
state for different chemical compositions of plasma, and we analyzed
contributions of individual elements to $\Gamma_1$.
  Methods. We studied the decrease in $\Gamma_1$ due to the ionization of heavy
elements in comparison with the value obtained for a pure hydrogen-helium
plasma. These types of differences are denoted as ""Z contributions"", and we
analyzed them for eight elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, S, Si, and Fe) as well as
for a mixture of elements corresponding to the solar chemical composition. We
compared linear combinations of individual Z contributions with the exact Z
contribution. Applying a least-squares technique to the decomposition of the
full Z contribution to a basis of individual-element contributions, we obtained
the mass fractions of the heavy elements.
  Results. The Z contribution of heavy elements can be described by a linear
combination of individual-element Z contributions with a high level of accuracy
of 5e-6 . The inverse problem of estimating the mass fractions of heavy
elements from a given $\Gamma_1$ profile was considered for the example of
solar-type mixtures. In ideal numerical simulations, the mass fractions of the
most abundant elements could be determined with a relative accuracy better than
a few tenths of a percent. In the presence of random or systematic errors in
the $\Gamma_1$ profile, abundance estimations become remarkably less accurate.

and wind properties of the massive stars in R136, in particular the parameters
related to wind clumping. Methods: We simultaneously analyse optical and UV
spectroscopy of 53 O-type and 3 WNh-stars using the FASTWIND model atmosphere
code and a genetic algorithm. The models account for optically thick clumps and
effects related to porosity and velocity-porosity, as well as a non-void
interclump medium. Results: We obtain stellar parameters, surface abundances,
mass-loss rates, terminal velocities and clumping characteristics and compare
these to theoretical predictions and evolutionary models. The clumping
properties include the density of the interclump medium and the
velocity-porosity of the wind. For the first time, these characteristics are

observed to descend through the solar corona, mostly in EUV and soft X-ray
frequencies. From their physical characteristics, SADs have been interpreted as
voided (subdense) bubbles and are related to magnetic reconnection processes
during long-term erupting flares. In this work we use numerical MHD simulations
to compute flux density maps, which are convolved with telescope beams to
synthesise images with the aim to assess the expected SADs emission at radio
wavelengths and propose observing strategies, including the instruments that
can be used. We assume that the emission is thermal bremsstrahlung from a fully
ionised plasma without any appreciable gyroresonance contribution since
magnetic fields are of the order of ~10 G. We find that SADs emission should be
optically thin in the frequency [10-1000] GHz range, and the spatially
integrated flux should be larger than 1 Jy. We conclude, therefore, that
observing SADs in radio frequencies between [0.5-1000] GHz is feasible with
present instrumentation. Moreover, since the emission is for the most part
optically thin, the flux density is proportional to temperature, density and
line-of-sight depth, and when combined with EUV and soft X-ray images, may
allow a better density and temperature determination of SADs.",0.3459677,0.10314405,0.1401917,C

solar atmosphere and for solar atmospheric seismology. The analytical
investigation of wave mode properties in a cylinder is of particular interest
in this domain, as many atmospheric structures can be modeled as such in a
first approximation. We use linearized ideal MHD to study quasimodes (global
modes that are damped through resonant absorption) with a frequency in the cusp
continuum, in a straight cylinder with a circular base and an inhomogeneous
layer at its boundary which separates two homogeneous plasma regions inside and
outside. We are in particular interested in the damping of these modes, and
shall hence try to determine their frequency as a function of background
parameters. After linearizing the ideal MHD equations, we find solutions to the
second-order differential equation for the perturbed total pressure in the
inhomogeneous layer in the form of Frobenius series around the regular singular
points that are the Alfv\'en and cusp resonant positions, as well as power
series around regular points. By connecting these solutions appropriately
through the inhomogeneous layer and with the solutions of the homogeneous
regions inside and outside the cylinder, we derive a dispersion relation for
the frequency of the eigenmodes of the system. From the dispersion relation, it
is also possible to find the frequency of quasimodes even though they are not
eigenmodes. As an example, we find the frequency of the slow surface sausage
quasimode as a function of the inhomogeneous layer's width, for values of the
longitudinal wavenumber relevant for photospheric conditions. The results were
found to match well the results found in another paper which studied the
resistive slow surface sausage eigenmode. We also discuss the perturbation

show that when a third parallel AWP of different initial position arrives at
the APAWI crossing region, it gives rise to a strong parallel electron beams

throughout their entire life. These outflows impact both the life and death of
these stars and their surroundings. Theoretical mass-loss rates of hot, massive
stars are derived to be used in applications such as stellar evolution. The
behaviour of these rates in the OB-star regime is analysed, and their effects
on massive-star evolution predictions is studied. Dynamically-consistent models
are computed by solving the spherically symmetric, steady-state
equation-of-motion for a large grid of hot, massive stars. The radiative
acceleration is derived from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative
transfer in the co-moving frame. The resulting mass-loss rates are used to
derive a simple scaling recipe with stellar parameters and to evaluate some
first impacts upon evolution tracks. We provide a new prescription for
steady-state, radiation-driven mass-loss from hot, massive stars depending on
their fundamental parameters. The rates for O-stars are lower by about a factor
~3 than the rates typically used in previous stellar-evolution calculations,
where differences generally decrease with increasing luminosity and
temperature. For cooler B-giants/supergiants we find larger discrepancies. This
arises because we do not find any systematic increase in mass-loss rates below
the so-called bi-stability region; indeed, our results do not show any sign of
a significant bi-stability jump within the parameter range covered by the grid.
Due to the lower mass-loss rates we find that envelopes are not easily stripped
by means of standard steady-state winds, making it difficult to create
classical Wolf-Rayet stars via this channel. However, a remaining key
uncertainty regarding these predictions concerns unsteady mass loss for very
high-luminosity stars close to the Eddington limit as well as the impact of
non-line-driven winds.",0.022350006,0.30250746,0.20738268,C

phase, in addition to the spectrum. The differential phase contains important
information about the structure and motion of stellar photosphere such as
stellar spots and non-radial pulsations, and particularly the rotation. Thus,
this interferometric observable strongly helps to constrain the stellar
fundamental parameters of fast rotators. The spectro-astrometry mainly uses the
photocentre displacements, which is a first approximation of the differential
phase, and is applicable only for unresolved or marginally objects. We study
here the sensitivity of relevant stellar parameters to the simulated
photocentres using the SCIROCCO code: a semi-analytical algorithm dedicated to
fast rotators, applied to two theoretical modeling stars based on Achernar and
Regulus, in order to classify the importance of these parameters and their
impact on the modeling. We compare our simulations with published VLTI/AMBER
data. This current work sets the limits of application of photocentre
displacements to fast rotators, and under which conditions we can use the
photocentres and/or the differential phase, through a pre-established physical
criterion. To validate our theoretical study, we apply our method of analysis
on observed data of the edge-on fast rotator Regulus. For unresolved targets,
with a visibility $V\sim 1$, the photocentre can constrain the main stellar
fundamental parameters of fast rotators, whereas from marginally resolved
objects ($0.8 \leq V < 1$), mainly the rotation axis position angle ($\rm
PA_{\rm rot}$) can be directly deduced from the vectorial photocentre
displacement, which is very important for young cluster studies.",-0.01573021,0.09254548,-0.29964608,A

temperatures from 4800 to 6200 K were measured and the average connective
(granulation) velocities were estimated. The absolute scale of the line shifts
for the stars was established on the basis of the derived dependence of the
shifts of solar lines on optical depth. For FGK solar-type stars, curves of
convection velocities as a function of the height in the atmosphere in a large
range of heights from 150 to 700 km were obtained for the first time. All these
curves indicate a decrease in blue shifts with height, which means that the
granulation velocities through the photosphere slow down to zero. In the lower
chromosphere, red shifts of strong Mg I lines are observed, which indicate a
change in the direction of granulation velocities to the opposite and confirm
the effects of reversal of granulation at heights above 600 km. In cooler K
stars, granulation shifts change with height on average from -50 to 100 m/s,
while they change more sharply in hotter FG stars from -700 to 300 m/s. The
gradient of the line shift curves increases with an increase in the effective
temperature and a decrease in gravity, metallicity, and age of the star. The
connective velocity of the star averaged over all analyzed heights increases
from -90 to -560 m/s from colder to hotter stars. It correlates with
macroturbulence, asymmetry of spectral lines, and the rotation velocity of the

with some young B-type runaways found several tens of kiloparsecs from the
plane traveling at speeds beyond the escape velocity. Young open clusters are a
likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through N-body interactions
or in binary supernova explosions. The excellent quality of Gaia astrometry
opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high
precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified
uniquely. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether
two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against
samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate
trajectories for known runaway stars where we used Gaia data and updated radial
velocities. We found that only half of the sample could be classified as
runaways while the others were walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned
out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their
trajectories and then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to
investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to
a dynamical ejection. In particular, we show that the classical runaways AE
Aurigae and $\mu$ Columbae might not have originated together, with $\mu$
Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC.
The second sample investigated comprises a set of distant runaway B stars in
the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral analyses.

cooling evolution. Thus, there is a need for a study of how the computations of
white dwarfs and their progenitors that are made to date may be affected by the
uncertainties of the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rates. In this work we
compute fully evolutionary sequences using the MESA code with initial masses in
the range of 0.90 <= Mi/Msun <= 3.05. We consider different adopted reaction
rates, obtained from the literature, as well as the extreme limits within their
uncertainties. As expected, we find that previous to the core helium burning
stage there are no changes to the evolution of the stars. However, the
subsequent stages are all affected by the uncertainties of the considered
reaction rate. In particular, we find differences to the convective core mass

negligible at small heliocentric distances. The fractional strahl density

the white dwarfs to better than 5 per cent. For the M~dwarfs we measure their
parameters to a precision of better than 6 per cent with the uncertainty
dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the M~dwarf mass-radius relationship.
This precision is better than what can typically be achieved with
low-resolution spectroscopy. The nature of this method means that it will be
applicable to LSST data in the future, enabling direct characterisation without
follow-up spectroscopy. Additionally, we characterise three new
post-common-envelope binaries from their eclipse photometry, finding two
systems containing hot helium-core white dwarfs with low-mass companions (one
near the brown dwarf transition regime) and a possible detached cataclysmic

velocity (RV) measurements is limited by noise sources from the surfaces of
host stars. Current techniques to suppress stellar magnetic activity rely on
decorrelation using an activity indicator (e.g., strength of the Ca II lines,
width of the cross-correlation function, broadband photometry) or measurement
of the RVs using only a subset of spectral lines that have been shown to be
insensitive to activity. Here, we combine the above techniques by constructing
a high signal-to-noise activity indicator, the depth metric $\mathcal{D}(t)$,
from the most activity-sensitive spectral lines using the ""line-by-line"" method
of Dumusque (2018). Analogous to photometric decorrelation of RVs or Gaussian
progress regression modeling of activity indices, time series modeling of
$\mathcal{D}(t)$ reduces the amplitude of magnetic activity in RV measurements;
in an $\alpha$CenB RV time series from HARPS, the RV RMS was reduced from 2.67
to 1.02 m s$^{-1}$. $\mathcal{D}(t)$ modeling enabled us to characterize
injected planetary signals as small as 1 m s$^{-1}$. In terms of noise
reduction and injected signal recovery, $\mathcal{D}(t)$ modeling outperforms
activity mitigation via the selection of activity-insensitive spectral lines.
For Sun-like stars with activity signals on the m s$^{-1}$ level, the depth
metric independently tracks rotationally modulated and multiyear stellar
activity with a level of quality similar to that of the FWHM of the CCF and

cycles (SC) 20-23) and KSO white-light images (2009-2016, for SC 24). We used
different statistical methods and approaches to analyse cycle related
variations, solar cycle phase-related variations and long-term variations of
the DR. $A$ and $B$ show statistically significant periodic variability. The
changes in $A$ related to solar cycle phase are in accordance with previously
reported theoretical and experimental results (higher $A$ during solar minimum,
lower $A$ during the maximum of activity), while changes in $B$ differ from the
theoretical predictions as we observe more negative values of $B$, that is, a
more pronounced DR during activity maximum. The main result of this paper for
the long-term variations in $A$ is the detection of a phase shift between the
activity flip (in the 1970s) and the equatorial rotation velocity flip (in the
early 1990s). During this time period both $A$ and activity show a secular
decreasing trend, indicating their correlation. Therefore, the theoretical
model fails in the phase-shift time period that occurs after the modern
Gleissberg maximum, while in the time period thereafter (after the 1990s),
theoretical and experimental results are consistent. The long-term variations
in $B$ in general yield an anticorrelation of $B$ and activity, as a rise of
$B$ is observed during the entire time period (1964-2016) we analysed, during
which activity decreased. We study for the first time the variation in solar DR

Therefore, one can expect that the orientation of the flux-rope axis of a
coronal mass ejection (CME) influences the propagation of the CME itself.
However, the determination of the CME orientation, especially from image data,
remains a challenging task to perform. This study aims to provide a reference
to different CME orientation determination methods in the near-Sun environment.
Also, it aims to investigate the non-radial flow in the sheath region of the
interplanetary CME (ICME) in order to provide the first proxy to relate the
ICME orientation with its propagation. We investigated 22 isolated CME-ICME
events in the period 2008-2015. We determined the CME orientation in the
near-Sun environment using the following: 1) a 3D reconstruction of the CME
with the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model applied to coronagraphic
images provided by the STEREO and SOHO missions and; 2) an ellipse fitting
applied to single spacecraft data from SOHO/LASCO C2 and C3 coronagraphs. In
the near-Earth environment, we obtained the orientation of the corresponding
ICME using in situ plasma and field data and also investigated the non-radial
flow (NRF) in its sheath region. The ability of GCS and ellipse fitting to
determine the CME orientation is found to be limited to reliably distinguish
only between the high or low inclination of the events. Most of the CME-ICME
pairs under investigation were found to be characterized by a low inclination.
For the majority of CME-ICME pairs, we obtain consistent estimations of the
tilt from remote and in situ data. The observed NRFs in the sheath region show
a greater y direction to z direction flow ratio for high-inclination events,

several solar and stellar phenomena, and is likely to play an important role in
transient events such as flares. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in flare
emissions may be a manifestation of oscillatory reconnection, but the
underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. In this paper, we present 2D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of two current-carrying magnetic flux
ropes with an out-of-plane magnetic field undergoing oscillatory reconnection
in which the two flux ropes merge into a single flux rope. We find that
oscillatory reconnection can occur intrinsically without an external
oscillatory driver during flux rope coalescence, which may occur both during
large-scale coronal loop interactions and the merging of plasmoids in
fragmented current sheets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that radially
propagating non-linear waves are produced in the aftermath of flux rope
coalescence, due to the post-reconnection oscillations of the merged flux rope.
The behaviour of these waves is found to be almost independent of the initial
out-of-plane magnetic field. It is estimated that the waves emitted through
merging coronal loops and merging plasmoids in loop-top current sheets would
have a typical phase speed of 90 km/s and 900 km/s respectively. It is possible
that the properties of the waves emitted during flux rope coalescence could be
used as a diagnostic tool to determine physical parameters within a coalescing
region.",0.2544524,0.25213873,0.00082110544,C

specifically developed for these spectra. We provide a catalog with the
atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and
projected rotation velocity (vsini). For cool stars (Teff < 6500 K), we also
calculated the H-alpha and LiI-6708 equivalent width, which are important

correct the [Fe/H] values derived with ROTFIT. We were able to identify
double-lined binaries, stars with variable RVs, lithium-rich giants, and
emission-line objects. Based on the H-alpha flux, we found 327 active stars. We

transition between the photosphere where the gas is almost neutral and the
fully ionized corona. As the collisional coupling between neutral and charged
particles decreases in the upper part of the chromosphere, the hydrodynamical
timescales may become comparable to the collisional timescale, and a two-fluid
model is needed. In this paper we describe the implementation and validation of
a two-fluid model which simultaneously evolves charges and neutrals, coupled by
collisions. The two-fluid equations are implemented in the fully open-source
MPI-AMRVAC code. In the photosphere and the lower part of the solar atmosphere,
where collisions between charged and neutral particles are very frequent, an
explicit time-marching would be too restrictive, since for stability the
timestep needs to be proportional to the inverse of the collision frequency.
This is overcome by evaluating the collisional terms implicitly using an
explicit-implicit (IMEX) scheme. The cases presented cover very different
collisional regimes and our results are fully consistent with related
literature findings. If collisional time and length scales are smaller than the
hydrodynamical scales usually considered in the solar chromosphere, density
structures seen in the neutral and charged fluids are similar, with the effect
of elastic collisions between charges and neutrals being similar to
diffusivity. Otherwise, density structures are different and the decoupling in
velocity between the two species increases. The use of IMEX schemes efficiently
avoids the small timestep constraints of fully explicit implementations in
strongly collisional regimes. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) greatly decreases
the computational cost, compared to uniform grid runs at the same effective

highly model-dependent. The lithium depletion boundary (LDB), based on the
presence or absence of lithium in low-mass stars, can be used to derive ages in
stellar associations of between 20 and 500~Ma. The purpose of this work is to
revise former LDB ages in stellar associations in a consistent way, taking
advantage of the homogeneous \textit{Gaia} parallaxes as well as bolometric
luminosity estimations that do not rely on monochromatic bolometric
corrections. We studied nine open clusters and three moving groups
characterised by a previous determination of the LDB age. We gathered all the
available information from our data and the literature: membership, distances,
photometric data, reddening, metallicity, and surface gravity. We re-assigned
membership and calculated bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures
using distances derived from Gaia DR2 and multi-wavelength photometry for
individual objects around the former LDB. We located the LDB using a
homogeneous method for all the stellar associations. Finally, we estimated the
age by comparing it with different evolutionary models. We located the LDB for

on time-scales of years. We detect a dominant period of $2.6433 \pm 0.0005$ d

reported high-frequency features from sector 7. We discuss the plausible
mechanisms that may be responsible for such variability in WR7, including
pulsations, binarity, co-rotating interacting regions (CIRs) and clumpy winds.
Given the lack of strong evidence for the presence of a stellar or compact
companion, we suggest that WR7 may pulsate in quasi-coherent modes in addition
to wind variability likely caused by CIRs on top of stochastic low-frequency
variability. WR7 is certainly a worthy target for future monitoring in both

estimated distance range of the SNR, and the {\it Gaia} proper motions to study
their kinematics. From the {\it Gaia} EDR3 photometry, we construct the HR
diagram of the selected sample, which we compare with the theoretical
predictions for the evolution of possible star companions of SNIa. We can
discard several proposed types of companions by combining kinematics and
photometry. We focus our study on the kinematically most peculiar star, {\it
Gaia} EDR3 5323900215411075328 (hereafter MV-G272), is a very clear outlier in
the motion along the Galactic plane, both as compared with the sample and with
the Besan\c{c}on model of the Galaxy. Its trajectory on the sky locates it at
the center of the SNR, 6,000--8,000 years ago, which constitutes a unique
characteristic among the 3,082 stars in the sample. Spectra have been obtained
allowing a stellar parameters determination and a chemical abundance analysis.
The star now appears as an M1-M2 dwarf. Its chemistry is consistent with that
of a M dwarf companion, where a deep convective envelope could have diluted the
material captured from the SN ejecta. We have also explored a wide area around
the SNR, looking for a possible hypervelocity star ejected by the SN explosion.
None has been found.
  In conclusion, we have a candidate to be the surviving companion of the SNIa
that resulted in SNR G272.2-3.2. It is supported by all its kinematical
characteristics and by its trajectory within the SNR. This opens the
possibility for SNe Ia originating in binary systems with a M-dwarf mass donor.",-0.20410565,-0.114754535,0.07972191,B

remains an unsolved riddle in the study of close binary systems. The Kepler
space telescope produced high precision photometry of nearly 3,000 eclipsing
binary systems, providing a unique opportunity to study the O'Connell effect in
a large sample and in greater detail than in previous studies. We have
characterized the observational properties - including temperature, luminosity,
and eclipse depth - of a set of 212 systems (7.3% of Kepler eclipsing binaries)
that display a maxima flux difference of at least 1%, representing the largest
sample of O'Connell effect systems yet studied. We explored how these
characteristics correlate with each other to help understand the O'Connell
effect's underlying causes. We also describe some system classes with peculiar
light curve features aside from the O'Connell effect (~30% of our sample),
including temporal variation and asymmetric minima. We found that the O'Connell
effect size's correlations with period and temperature are inconsistent with
Kouzuma's starspot study. Up to 20% of systems display the parabolic eclipse
timing variation signal expected for binaries undergoing mass transfer. Most
systems displaying the O'Connell effect have the brighter maximum following the
primary eclipse, suggesting a fundamental link between which maximum is
brighter and the O'Connell effect's physical causes. Most importantly, we find
that the O'Connell effect occurs exclusively in systems where the components
are close enough to significantly affect each other, suggesting that the
interaction between the components is ultimately responsible for causing the
O'Connell effect.",-0.19779846,-0.16752023,-0.009033552,B

thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for
astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them.
This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star
catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a
catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly
together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the
completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of
the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is
performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R
diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1
among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems
illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues.
Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf
companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also
presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of
previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate
binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis
of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars
using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints
on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new
exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one
super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring
confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.",-0.08484202,-0.21393555,0.057870477,A

Before the stars arrive on
the zero-age main sequence, they form in the collapses of molecular clouds,
gain matter through accretion processes, and compress their cores until
hydrogen can burn in full equilibrium. Although this evolutionary phase lasts a
relatively short time, it is the imprint of these important physical processes
that is often ignored by simplified assumptions. While asteroseismology offers
a great tool to investigate these physical processes, studying pre-MS
oscillations in turn has the potential to further advance the field.
Asteroseismology of pre-main sequence stars faces observational and theoretical
challenges. The remnants of their birth environment which is often still
surrounding the young stars causes variability that can interfere with the
signal of pulsations. The lack of long time-base satellite observations in
addition limits the applications of the method. Theoretical models of pre-main
sequence stars include several assumptions and simplifications that influence
the calculation of pulsation frequencies and excitation properties of pulsation
modes. Keeping all this in mind, the prospects for pre-main sequence
asteroseismology are manifold. An improved understanding of the structure of
young stellar objects has the potential to answer some of the open questions of
stellar evolution, including angular momentum transport and the formation of
magnetic fields. While gyrochronology, for example, struggles to determine the
ages of the youngest clusters, pulsations in pre-main sequence stars can
function as an independent age indicator yielding higher precision for single
stars. The increasing interest of stellar astrophysics in general to
investigate the formation and early evolution of stars and planets illustrates
the growing importance of pre-main sequence asteroseismology.",-0.053492665,0.27120864,0.31865823,C

from a star with an initial mass of 12 solar masses through the photospheric

the lightcurves are well reproduced. Our work further strengthens the evidence
that this SN originated from a star with an initial mass of about 12 solar
masses that had lost all but tiny (<0.1 solar masses) fraction of its hydrogen
envelope. We also investigate the effects of the macroscopic mixing by
comparing macroscopically and microscopically mixed models, and by varying the
clumping geometry. In the photospheric phase, we find strong effects on the
effective opacity in the macroscopically mixed regions, which affects the model
lightcurves. The diffusion peak is considerably narrower in the macroscopically
mixed case, and differs strongly if the radioactive material in the helium
envelope is allowed to expand more than in our standard model. The effect is
mainly geometrical, and is driven by the expansion of the clumps containing
radioactive material. These findings has implications for lightcurve modelling
of stripped-envelope SNe in general, and the effect would increase the
estimated ejecta masses. In the nebular phase, we find strong effects on the
collisional cooling rates in the macroscopically mixed regions, which affects
lines driven by collisional cooling, in particular the [Ca II] 7291, 7323 and

first-overtone RR Lyrae stars, that form a period ratio around 0.61 with the
period of the first overtone, are a common phenomenon for RRc and RRd stars, as
well as for first-overtone classical Cepheids. The recently proposed model
explains these signals as harmonics of non-radial modes of degrees 8 or 9 in
the case of RR Lyrae stars and 7, 8, or 9 in the case of classical Cepheids. We
selected at least triple-mode RR Lyrae stars pulsating in radial and non-radial
modes for asteroseismic modeling. We assume the identification of the
non-radial modes as predicted by the model. We calculated a dense grid of
models for RR Lyrae stars using envelope pulsation code. By matching first
overtone period and period ratios we obtained physical parameters for the
selected sample of triple-mode stars. It is the very first attempt of modeling
RR Lyrae stars with non-radial modes. We compared our results with predictions
of stellar evolution theory, which resulted in a mass discrepancy more
noticeable for long-period stars: pulsation masses seem higher than
evolutionary masses. We compared metallicity estimates for RRc stars from

(ii) there is a power-law relation between cluster mass and maximum number of
BSSs, (iii) the formation mechanism of BSSs is dominated by binary mass
transfer (54-67%) though there exists a 10-16% chance of BSSs forming through

radio flux (F10.7) value and a linear correlation is found between each that we
call the Schwab Woods Mason (SWM) model. The linear trends show that one can
estimate the solar spectrum between 0.5 keV and 10 keV based on the F10.7

the quiescent sun contribution to the spectra and is essentially independent of
solar activity, meaning the daily average quiescent sun is accurately described

emission measure corresponding to this temperature needs to be adjusted for
higher or lower solar intensity. The warmer temperature component is shown to
represent active region contributions to the spectra and varies between 5 MK to
6 MK. GOES XRS-B data between 1-8 Angstroms is used to validate this model and

still poses problems for observations and theoretical models. In recent
studies, the importance of the magnetic star-disk interaction for stellar spin
evolution has been elaborated. The accretion disk in these studies, however, is
only represented by a simplified model and important features are not
considered. We combined the implicit hydrodynamic TAPIR disk code with a
stellar spin evolution model. The influence of stellar magnetic fields on the
disk dynamics, the radial position of the inner disk radius, as well as the
influence of stellar rotation on the disk were calculated self-consistently.
Within a defined parameter space, we can reproduce the majority of fast and
slow rotating stars observed in young stellar clusters. Additionally, the back
reaction of different stellar spin evolutionary tracks on the disk can be
analyzed. Disks around fast rotating stars are located closer to the star.
Consequently, the disk midplane temperature in the innermost disk region
increases significantly compared to slow rotating stars. We can show the
effects of stellar rotation on episodic accretion outbursts. The higher
temperatures of disks around fast rotating stars result in more outbursts and a
longer outbursting period over the disk lifetime. The combination of a
long-term hydrodynamic disk and a stellar spin evolution model allows the
inclusion of previously unconsidered effects such as the back-reaction of
stellar rotation on the long-term disk evolution and the occurrence of
accretion outbursts. However, a wider parameter range has to be studied to
further investigate these effects. Additionally, a possible interaction between
our model and a more realistic stellar evolution code (e.g., the MESA code) can

However, it is not clear what this process looks like and where the dust is
condensing in the circumstellar environment. By characterizing the location of
the dust and the molecules in the close environment of an AGB star, we aim to
achieve a better understanding the history of the dust formation process. We
observed the carbon star R Scl with the VLTI-MATISSE instrument in L- and
N-bands. The high angular resolution of the VLTI observations, combined with a
large uv-plane coverage allowed us to use image reconstruction methods. To
constrain the dust and molecules' location, we used two different methods: MIRA
image reconstruction and the 1D code RHAPSODY. We found evidence of C2H2 and
HCN molecules between 1 and 3.4 Rstar which is much closer to the star than the
location of the dust (between 3.8 and 17.0 Rstar). We also estimated a
mass-loss rate of 1.2+-0.4x10-6 Msun per yr. In the meantime, we confirmed the
previously published characteristics of a thin dust shell, composed of
amorphous carbon (amC) and silicon carbide (SiC). However, no clear SiC feature
has been detected in the MATISSE visibilities. This might be caused by
molecular absorption that can affect the shape of the SiC band at 11.3 micron.
The appearance of the molecular shells is in good agreement with predictions
from dynamical atmosphere models. For the first time, we co-located dust and
molecules in the environment of an AGB star. We confirm that the molecules are
located closer to the star than the dust. The MIRA images unveil the presence
of a clumpy environment in the fuzzy emission region beyond 4.0 Rstar.
Furthermore, with the available dynamic range and angular resolution, we did
not detect the presence of a binary companion. Additional observations

sunspots during sunspot decay and compared it with the flow field of
supergranular cells. The decay of a sunspot proceeds as it interacts with its
surroundings. This is manifested by the changes observed in the flow field
surrounding the decaying spot. We now investigate in detail the evolution of
the flow field in the direct periphery of the sunspots of the same sample and
aim to provide a complete picture of the role of large-scale flows present in
sunspot cells. We analyse the horizontal velocity profiles of sunspots obtained
from observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We follow their evolution across the solar
disc from their stable phase to their decay and their final disappearance. We
find two different scenarios for the evolution of the flow region surrounding a
spot in the final stage of its decay: (i) either the flow cell implodes and
disappears under the action of the surrounding supergranules or (ii) it
outlives the spot. In the later case, an inwards flow towards the remaining
naked spot develops in the vicinity closest to the spot followed by an outflow
further out. These findings provide observational evidence to theoretical
predictions by realistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sunspot and moat region
simulations. The Evershed flow and the moat flow, both connected to the
presence of fully fledged sunspots in a spot cell, vanish when penumbrae decay.
Moat flows decline into supergranular flows. The final fate of a spot cell
depends on its interaction with the surrounding supergranular cells. In the
case of non-imploding spot cells, the remaining naked spot develops a
converging inflow driven by radiative cooling and a geometrical alignment of
granules in its periphery which is similar to that observed in pores.",0.24782641,0.24282816,0.10539889,C

massive red supergiants tend to have a sizeable radiative layer between the
dense helium core and the convective envelope. Our formalism treats the
common-envelope phase in two stages: dynamical in-spiral through the outer
convective envelope and thermal timescale mass transfer from the radiative
intershell. With fiducial choices of parameters, the new formalism typically
predicts much wider separations compared to the classical energy formalism.
Moreover, our formalism predicts that final separations strongly depend on the
donor evolutionary stage and companion mass. Our formalism provides a
physically-motivated alternative option for population synthesis studies to
treat common-envelope evolution. This treatment will impact on predictions for
massive-star binaries, including gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries and

magnetohydrodynamic wave energy into the outer regions of the solar atmosphere.
Pore observations often contain isolated and/or unconnected structures,

atmospheric height. Here, using high resolution observations acquired by the
Dunn Solar Telescope, we examine photospheric and chromospheric wave signatures
from a unique collection of magnetic pores originating from the same decaying
sunspot. Wavelet analysis of high cadence photospheric imaging reveals the
ubiquitous presence of slow sausage mode oscillations, coherent across all
photospheric pores through comparisons of intensity and area fluctuations,
producing statistically significant in-phase relationships. The universal
nature of these waves allowed an investigation of whether the wave activity
remained coherent as they propagate. Utilizing bi-sector Doppler velocity
analysis of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line, alongside comparisons of the modeled
spectral response function, we find fine-scale 5 mHz power amplification as the
waves propagate into the chromosphere. Phase angles approaching zero degrees
between co-spatial bi-sectors spanning different line depths indicate standing
sausage modes following reflection against the transition region boundary.
Fourier analysis of chromospheric velocities between neighboring pores reveals
the annihilation of the wave coherency observed in the photosphere, with
examination of the intensity and velocity signals from individual pores
indicating they behave as fractured wave guides, rather than monolithic
structures. Importantly, this work highlights that wave morphology with
atmospheric height is highly complex, with vast differences observed at

massive stars via mass-loss quenching, magnetic braking, and efficient angular
momentum transport, which we aim to quantify in this work. We use the MESA
software instrument to compute an extensive main-sequence grid of stellar
structure and evolution models, as well as isochrones, accounting for the
effects attributed to a surface fossil magnetic field. The grid is densely
populated in initial mass (3-60 M$_\odot$), surface equatorial magnetic field
strength (0-50 kG), and metallicity (representative of the Solar neighbourhood
and the Magellanic Clouds). We use two magnetic braking and two chemical mixing
schemes and compare the model predictions for slowly-rotating,
nitrogen-enriched (""Group 2"") stars with observations in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. We quantify a range of initial field strengths that allow for producing
Group 2 stars and find that typical values (up to a few kG) lead to solutions.
Between the subgrids, we find notable departures in surface abundances and
evolutionary paths. In our magnetic models, chemical mixing is always less
efficient compared to non-magnetic models due to the rapid spin-down. We
identify that quasi-chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution by efficient
mixing could be prevented by fossil magnetic fields. We recommend comparing
this grid of evolutionary models with spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic
observations with the goals of i) revisiting the derived stellar parameters of
known magnetic stars, and ii) observationally constraining the uncertain
magnetic braking and chemical mixing schemes.",-0.26134464,0.22054246,0.16367763,B

as well as faculae/plage and network. Such data are also important for
understanding the magnetic activity and variability of the Sun and Sun-like
stars. The longest available direct faculae/plage datasets are white-light
facular and Ca II K observations going back to 1874 and 1892, respectively.
Prior to that time, the only direct data available are for sunspots. We
reassess the relationship between plage areas and sunspot records (areas and
numbers) since 1892, to allow reconstructions of facular/plage areas which can
be employed for studies going further back in time, i.e. over the period when
solely sunspot observations are available. We use the plage areas derived from
38 consistently processed Ca II K archives as well as the plage area composite
based on these archives. We find the relationship between plage and sunspot
areas and numbers to be well represented by a power law function. We further
find that the relationships depend on the bandwidth and the solar cycle
strength. The reconstructions with a power law relationship are in good
agreement with the original plage area series, whereas employment of a
cycle-strength-dependent relationship improves the reconstructions only
marginally. Performing the same analysis on other previously published plage
area series, usually derived from a single archive with diverse processing
techniques, returns different results when using different time series. This
highlights the importance of applying a consistent processing to the various
archives and demonstrates the uncertainties introduced by using previously
published series. Our results have implications for past solar activity and
irradiance reconstructions as well as for stellar activity studies, which
sometimes assume a linear dependence between plage and sunspot areas.",0.06585117,0.25796732,-0.044516165,C

It was found that the eclipse timing variation of the system could be
represented by a periodic oscillation of 17.6 $\pm$ 0.3 years with a
semi-amplitude of 0.0041 $\pm$ 0.0001 d. The orbital and physical parameters
were derived by simultaneously analyzing the TESS light and RV curves using the

$R_{2}$ = 1.35 $\pm $ 0.01 R$_{\odot}$. Furthermore, multiple frequency
analyses were performed for the light-curve residuals from the WD model. As a
result, we detected 17 pressure-mode pulsations in the region of 40.15 - 52.37

and study changes due to stellar evolution. In this work, we study the former
by calculating a set of evolutionary tracks of stars with an initial mass of 4
to 7 $M_\odot$, varying the initial rotation rate and metallicity, using the
stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).
Using Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP), a recently added functionality of MESA,
we obtained theoretical instability strip (IS) edges and linear periods for the
radial fundamental mode. Period-age, period-age-temperature, period-luminosity,
and period-luminosity-temperature relationships were derived for three rotation
rates and metallicities, showing a dependence on crossing number, position in
the IS, rotation, and metallicity. We calculated period change rates (PCRs)
based on the linear periods from RSP. We compared our models with literature
results using the Geneva code, and found large differences, as expected due to
the different implementations of rotation between codes. In addition, we
compared our theoretical PCRs with those measured in our recent work for Large
Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. We found good overall agreement, even though our
models do not reach the short-period regime exhibited by the empirical data.
Implementations of physical processes not yet included in our models, such as
pulsation-driven mass loss, an improved treatment of convection that may lead
to a better description of the instability strip edges, as well as
consideration of a wider initial mass range, could all help improve the
agreement with the observed PCRs.",0.11295029,-0.20559785,0.048204366,A

complicated, with multiple periods, changing amplitudes, and evidence of

associated with the higher temperature stars in the sample (7250 and 8000 K).

under-abundance is one of the criteria that characterise such stars. Thanks to

We explore the required conditions, in terms of mixing processes or mass loss,

The models are computed with the Toulouse-Geneva evolution code, which uses the

from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Other parameter-dependent turbulent mixing
processes are also considered. A global mass loss is also implemented. When no

the models whose superficial layers are fully mixed down to the iron

Most flybys in the Galactic disk are distant, beyond 10,000 AU, and
have characteristic velocities of about 70 km/s. However, deep and fast
encounters also take place, albeit with lower probability, particularly if one
of the objects involved is a stellar remnant ejected during a supernova. WD
0810-353 might be a high velocity white dwarf, and it was recently identified
as heading straight for the Solar System; however, the Gaia DR3 data that
support its future deep and fast flyby are regarded as suspicious.
  Aims. Here, we reanalyze the Gaia DR3 data set associated with WD 0810-353 to
confirm or reject the reality of its Solar System flyby and also to investigate
its possible runaway status.
  Methods. We studied the evolution of WD 0810-353 forward in time using N-body
simulations. We computed the distribution of distances of closest approach and
their associated times of perihelion passage. We used a statistical analysis of
the kinematics of this object to assess its possible hypervelocity. We compared
its mean BP/RP spectrum to those of other well-studied white dwarfs.
  Results. We confirm that WD 0810-353 is headed for the Solar System, but the
actual parameters of the encounter depend strongly on its radial velocity. The
Gaia DR3 value of -373.74+/-8.18 km/s is strongly disfavored by our analyses.
Its mean BP/RP spectrum suggests a value over ten times higher based on the
position of its putative Halpha line. However, spectral matching using other
white dwarfs with non-Gaia data indicate a radial velocity in the interval
(-60, -70) km/s.
  Conclusions. These results confirm the future flyby of WD 0810-353 near the

sheared magnetic polarity inversion lines, indicative of the complex magnetic
configurations that store huge amounts of free magnetic energy and helicity.
This knowledge is transformed into parameters that can help us distinguish
efficiently between quiet, flare-, and CME-productive active regions.
Nonetheless, flare and CME prediction still faces a number of challenges. The
magnetic field information is constrained at the photosphere and accessed only
from one vantage point of observation; the dynamic behavior of active regions
is still not fully incorporated into predictions; the stochasticity of flares

properties have been put forward to describe different aspects of magnetic
energy storage mechanisms in active regions and offer the opportunity of
parametric studies for over an entire solar cycle. This inventory of predictors

of this paper is to compare the basic geometrical (size, orientation) and
physical (intensity, lifetime) properties of the EUV brightenings with regions
of energy dissipation in a non-potential coronal magnetic field simulation. In
the simulation, HMI line-of-sight magnetograms are used as input to drive the
evolution of solar coronal magnetic fields and energy dissipation. We applied
an automatic EUV brightening detection method to EUV images obtained on 30 May
2020 by the HRI_EUV telescope. We applied the same detection method to the
simulated energy dissipation maps from the non-potential simulation to detect
simulated brightenings. We detected EUV brightenings with density of
1.41x10^{-3} brightenings/Mm^2 in the EUI observations and simulated
brightenings between 2.76x10^{-2} - 4.14x10^{-2} brightenings/Mm^2 in the
simulation, for the same time range. Although significantly more brightenings
were produced in the simulations, the results show similar distributions of the
key geometrical and physical properties of the observed and simulated
brightenings. We conclude that the non-potential simulation can successfully
reproduce statistically the characteristic properties of the EUV brightenings
(typically with more than 85% similarity); only the duration of the events is
significantly different between observations and simulation. Further
investigations based on high-cadence and high-resolution magnetograms from
Solar Orbiter are under consideration to improve the agreement between
observation and simulation.",0.18891539,0.35372987,-0.14341034,C

their circumstellar discs fragment onto multiple self-gravitating objects.
Accretion of these by HMYSO may explain episodic accretion bursts discovered
recently. We post-process results of a previous 3D simulation of a HMYSO disc
with a 1D code that resolves the disc and object dynamics down to the stellar
surface. We find that burst-like deposition of material into the inner disc
seen in 3D simulations by itself does not always signify powerful accretion
bursts. Only high density post-collapse clumps crossing the inner computational
boundary may result in observable bursts. The rich physics of the inner disc
has a significant impact on the expected accretion bursts: (1) In the standard
turbulent viscosity discs, migrating objects can stall at a migration trap at
the distance of a few au from the star. However, in discs powered by magnetised
winds, the objects are able to cross the trap and produce bursts akin to those
observed so far. (2) Migrating objects may interact with and modify the thermal
(hydrogen ionisation) instability of the inner disc, which can be responsible
for longer duration and lower luminosity bursts in HMYSOs. (3) If the central
star is bloated to a fraction of an au by a previous episode of high accretion
rate, or if the migrating object is particularly dense, a merger rather than a
disc-mediated accretion burst results; (4) Object disruption bursts may be
super-Eddington, leading to episodic feedback on HMYSO surroundings via
powerful outflows.",0.08050436,0.021452738,0.2498742,C

to be a key process of formation of solar active regions and driving solar

process is commonly studied using numerical simulations. In this paper, we
developed a numerical model to simulate the emergence of a twisted magnetic
flux tube from the convection zone to the corona using the AMR--CESE--MHD code,
which is based on the conservation-element solution-element method with
adaptive mesh refinement. The result of our simulation agrees with that of many
previous ones with similar initial conditions but using different numerical
codes. In the early stage, the flux tube rises from the convection zone as
driven by the magnetic buoyancy until it reaches close to the photosphere. The
emergence is decelerated there and with piling-up of the magnetic flux, the
magnetic buoyancy instability is triggered, which allows the magnetic field to
partially enter into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, two gradually separated
polarity concentration zones appear in the photospheric layer, transporting the
magnetic field and energy into the atmosphere through their vortical and
shearing motions. Correspondingly, the coronal magnetic field has also been
reshaped to a sigmoid configuration containing a thin current layer, which
resembles the typical pre-eruptive magnetic configuration of an active region.

resulting from the spatial variations in the shock waves that accelerate them.
Differences in the shock strength at the solar longitude of a spacecraft and at
the footpoint of its connecting magnetic field line, nominally 55 degrees to
the west, drive much of that variation. The shock wave itself, together with
energetic particles trapped near it by self-amplified Alfven waves, forms an
underlying autonomous structure that can drive across magnetic field lines
intact, spreading proton intensities in a widening SEP longitude distribution.
During the formation of this fundamental structure, historically called an
""energetic storm particle"" (ESP) event, many SEPs leak away early, amplifying
waves as they flow along well-connected field lines and broaden the
distribution outward; behind this structure between the shock and the Sun a
""reservoir"" of quasi-trapped SEPs forms. Very large SEP events are complicated
by additional extensive wave growth that can spread an extended ESP-like
trapping region. The multiplicity of shock-related processes contributing to
the observed SEP profiles causes correlations of the events to be poorly
represented by the peak intensities commonly used. In fact, the extensive
spatial distributions of SEPs are sometimes interwoven with the structures of
the shocks that have accelerated them and sometimes free. We should consider

helicity, in both photospheric fluxes and coronal content, that persist for a
few hours after eruptions, but no clear changes, notably in relative helicity,
for confined events; (2) significant increases in the twist of photospheric
fields in eruptive events, with twist uncertainties too large in confined
events to constrain twist changes (and lower overall twist in confined events);

two additional outbursts in 2004-2006, and ten outbursts in 2013-2022. Outburst
light curves are irregular and multipeaked, exhibiting a wide variety of peak
magnitude, duration, and shape. The more recent outbursts (after 2010) repeat
with a period of $198.4\pm{2}$ d, while the pre-2010 period seems to be a few

that these periodic eruptions arise from violent interaction around times of
periastron in an eccentric binary system, similar to the periastron encounters
of $\eta$ Carinae leading up to its Great Eruption, and resembling the erratic
pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. We attribute the irregularity of the eruptions
to the interplay between the orbit and the variability of the luminous blue
variable (LBV) primary star, wherein each successive periastron pass may have a
different intensity or duration due to the changing radius and mass-loss rate
of the LBV-like primary. Such outbursts may occasionally be weak or
undetectable if the LBV is relatively quiescent at periastron, but can be much
more extreme when the LBV is active. The observed change in orbital period may
be a consequence of mass lost in outbursts. Given the similarity to the

spicules and coronal jets, which can elucidate potential connections between
plasma jetting activity at different scales. With high-resolution observations

investigate the origin of five groups of recurrent active-region macrospicules.
Before the launch of each macrospicule, we detect a compact bright patch (BP)
at its base where a newly emerging dipole contacts and cancel with the
pre-existing ambient field. The spectral diagnosis from the {\em Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph} at one of BPs reveals signatures of reconnection
at the lower atmosphere. Multiwavelength imaging of these BPs show that they
mainly occur at the rising phase of the flux emergence and slowly ascend from
the lower to the upper chromosphere. Remarkable macrospicules occur and fade
out once the BPs appear and decay from the AIA 304 A images, respectively. We
suggest that these macrospicules and related BPs form in a common reconnection
process, in which the increasing reconnection height between the emerging
dipole and the ambient field results in the observed variations from BPs to
macrospicules. Interestingly, most macrospicules show similar characteristics
to larger-scale coronal jets and/or smaller-scale spicules, i.e., the rotating
motions, the presence of minifilaments and BPs before the eruptions, and
magnetic flux emergence and cancellation. We conclude that the formation

compare C, N, Al, Si, and Ti isotopic abundances measured in presolar grains

energies is considered, with the high energy models favouring the formation of
a C/Si zone enriched in $^{12}$C, $^{28}$Si, and $^{44}$Ti. Eighteen of the 21
models have H ingested into the He-shell and different abundances of H
remaining from such H-ingestion. CCSN models with intermediate to low energy
(that do not develop a C/Si zone) cannot reproduce the $^{28}$Si and $^{44}$Ti
isotopic abundances in grains without assuming mixing with O-rich CCSN ejecta.
The most $^{28}$Si-rich grains are reproduced by energetic models when material
from the C/Si zone is mixed with surrounding C-rich material, and the observed
trends of the $^{44}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti and $^{49}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti ratios are consistent
with the C-rich C/Si zone. For the models with H-ingestion, high and
intermediate explosion energies allow the production of enough $^{26}$Al to
reproduce the $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al measurements of most SiC-X and LD graphites.
In both cases, the highest $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ratio is obtained with H still

the envelope may be ejected leaving behind a tight remnant binary system of two
stellar cores, or the cores merge retaining part of the envelope material. The
exact outcome of common-envelope evolution is critical for in the formation of
X-ray binaries, supernova progenitors, the progenitors of compact-object
mergers that emit detectable gravitational waves, and many other objects of
fundamental astrophysical relevance. The wide ranges of spatial and temporal
timescales that characterize common-envelope interactions and the lack of
spatial symmetries present a substantial challenge to generating consistent
models. Therefore, these critical phases are one of the largest sources for
uncertainty in classical treatments of binary stellar evolution.
