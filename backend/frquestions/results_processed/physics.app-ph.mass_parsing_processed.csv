shape of the Miram curve knee is an important figure of merit for thermionic
vacuum cathodes. Specifically, cathodes with a sharp Miram curve knee at low

previous work on modeling nonuniform thermionic emission revealed that the

knee. The results indicate there are three main physical parameters which
significantly impact the shape of the Miram curve. Such physical knowledge
directly connects the patch size, work function values, anode-cathode voltage,

investigate the absorption strength of NFAs by building a database of

pi-conjugated molecules. The calculations are first validated by comparison
with experimental measurements on liquid and solid state using common fullerene
and non-fullerene acceptors. We find that the molar extinction coefficient
({\epsilon}_(d,max)) shows reasonable agreement between calculation in vacuum
and experiment for molecules in solution, highlighting the effectiveness of
TDDFT for predicting optical properties of organic pi-conjugated molecules. We
then perform a statistical analysis based on molecular descriptors to identify
which features are important in defining the absorption strength. This allows
us to identify structural features that are correlated with high absorption
strength in NFAs and could be used to guide molecular design: highly absorbing
NFAs should possess a planar, linear, and fully conjugated molecular backbone
with highly polarisable heteroatoms. We then exploit a random decision forest
to draw predictions for {\epsilon}_(d,max) using a computational framework
based on extended tight-binding Hamiltonians, which shows reasonable predicting
accuracy with lower computational cost than TDDFT. This work provides a general

Traditionally, atomic magnetometers are utilized for moving MEGs recording and
a large compensation coil system is utilized for background magnetic field
compensation. Here we described a new potential candidate: an optically pumped
atomic co-magnetometer(OPACM) for moving MEGs recording. In the OPACM,
hyper-polarized nuclear spins could produce a magnetic field which will shield
the background fluctuation low frequency magnetic field noise while the the
fast changing MEGs signal could be recorded. The nuclear spins look like an
automatic magnetic field shields and dynamically compensate the fluctuated
background magnetic field noise. In this article, the magnetic field
compensation is studied theoretically and we find that the compensation is
closely related to several parameters such as the electron spin magnetic field,
the nuclear spin magnetic field and the holding magnetic field. Based on the
model, the magnetic field compensation could be optimized. We also
experimentally studied the magnetic field compensation and the responses of the
OPACM to different frequencies of magnetic field are measured. We show that the
OPACM owns a clear suppression of low frequency magnetic field under 1Hz and
response to magnetic field's frequencies around the band of the MEGs. Magnetic
field sensitivity of $3fT/Hz^{1/2}$ has been achieved. Finally, we do a

microstructure of a Li-ion battery's separator and are adopted as key input
parameters in advanced battery models. Herein, a general classification of the
tortuosity for a porous medium is introduced based on its bi-fold significance,
i.e., the geometrical and physical tortuosities. Then, three different methods
for the determination of separator's electrical tortuosity are introduced and
compared, which include the empirical Bruggeman equation, the experimental
method using Electrochemical Impedance Spectrum (EIS) testing a the numerical
method using realistic 3D microstructure of the separator obtained from
nanoscale X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT). In addition, the connection between
the geometrical tortuosity and the electrical tortuosity of a separator is
established by introducing the electrical phenomenological factor (\b{eta}_e),
which can facilitate the understanding of the relationship between the
microstructure characteristics and transport properties of the separators.
Furthermore, to quantitively compare the values of the tortuosities determined
by different methods, the corresponding effective transport coefficients

devices. For high-speed and low-power data storage and processing applications,
fast reversal by an ultrashort laser pulse is extremely important. We
demonstrate optical switching of Tb/Comultilayer-based nanoscale MTJs by
combining optical writing and electrical read-out methods. A 90 fs-long laser
pulse switches the magnetization of the storage layer (SL). The change in
magnetoresistance between the SL and a reference layer (RL) is probed
electrically across the tunnel barrier. Single-shot switching is demonstrated
by varying the cell diameter from 300 nm to 20 nm. The anisotropy,
magnetostatic coupling, and switching probability exhibit cell-size dependence.
By suitable association of laser fluence and magnetic field, successive
commutation between high-resistance and low-resistance states is achieved. The
switching dynamics in a continuous film is probed with the magneto-optical Kerr
