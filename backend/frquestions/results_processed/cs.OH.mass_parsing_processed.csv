crisis, renewable energy is to replace a substantial part of coal or nuclear
plants to prevent greenhouse gases or toxic waste entering the atmosphere. This
relatively quick shift in energy production, primarily pushed by increasing
political and economical pressure, requires enormous effort on the part of the
energy providers to balance out production fluctuations. Consequently, a lot of
research is conducted in the key area of stochastic unit commitment (UC) on
electrical grids and microgrids. The term unit commitment includes a large

Renkin'), arxiv.Result.Author('J. Bischofberger'), arxiv.Result.Author('E. Schikuta'), arxiv.Result.Author('A. Baca')]","Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a
foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association
football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been
validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is
that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of
player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable
positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football
players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of
actually reachable positions.
  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that
measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all
possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of
reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a
manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four
different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion
with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed
limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show
that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a
limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate
distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two
segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the
tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of
real-world player motion.",0.451985,0.70066077,-0.0035978798,C_centroid

one or more changes on the performance of a process. Mainstream approaches in
this space suffer from various limitations, some stemming from the fact that
they treat resources as undifferentiated entities grouped into resource pools.
These approaches assume that all resources in a pool have the same performance
and share the same availability calendars. Previous studies have acknowledged
these assumptions, without quantifying their impact on simulation model
accuracy. This paper addresses this gap in the context of simulation models
automatically discovered from event logs. The paper proposes a simulation
approach and a method for discovering simulation models, wherein each resource
is treated as an individual entity, with its own performance and availability
calendar. An evaluation shows that simulation models with differentiated
resources more closely replicate the distributions of cycle times and the work
rhythm in a process than models with undifferentiated resources.",-0.28341523,0.29517823,0.20957844,A_centroid

challenging task on the journey of making those functions available to the
