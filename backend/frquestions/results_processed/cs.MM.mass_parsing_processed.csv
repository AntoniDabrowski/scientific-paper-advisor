growth, it is at the same time seriously threatened by the limitations of the
battery technology, which does not keep pace with the evergrowing increase in
energy requirements of mobile applications. A novel approach for reducing the
energy appetite of mobile apps comes from the approximate computing field,
which proposes techniques that in a controlled manner sacrifice computation
accuracy for higher energy savings. Building on this philosophy we propose a
context-aware mobile video quality adaptation that reduces the energy needed
for video playback, while ensuring that a user's quality expectations with
respect to the mobile video are met. We confirm that the decoding resolution
can play a significant role in reducing the overall power consumption of a
mobile device and conduct two user studies to investigate how the context in
which a video is played, its content, and the user's personality, modulate a
user's quality expectations. We discover that a user's physical activity, the
spatial/temporal properties of the video, and the user's personality traits
interact and jointly influence the minimal acceptable playback resolution,
paving the way for context-adaptable approximate mobile computing.",0.37301016,-0.14371943,0.055091687,A

professional and personal contexts. However, popular video conferencing
applications present limitations in terms of quality of communication,
immersion and social meaning. VR remote communication applications offer a
greater sense of co-presence and mutual sensing of emotions between remote
users. Previous research on these applications has shown that realistic point
cloud user reconstructions offer better immersion and communication as compared
to synthetic user avatars. However, photorealistic point clouds require a large
volume of data per frame and are challenging to transmit over bandwidth-limited
networks. Recent research has demonstrated significant improvements to
perceived quality by optimizing the usage of bandwidth based on the position
and orientation of the user's viewport with user-adaptive streaming. In this
work, we developed a real-time VR communication application with an adaptation
engine that features tiled user-adaptive streaming based on user behaviour. The
application also supports traditional network adaptive streaming. The
contribution of this work is to evaluate the impact of tiled user-adaptive
streaming on quality of communication, visual quality, system performance and
task completion in a functional live VR remote communication system. We perform
a subjective evaluation with 33 users to compare the different streaming
conditions with a neck exercise training task. As a baseline, we use
uncompressed streaming requiring ca. 300Mbps and our solution achieves similar

weighting strategy in which the history of different video interactions
generate scores based on the context of each playback. The resultant scores are

visualisation was implemented and deployed in an undergraduate course at a

matching degree between videos and uploader-selected background music is a
major issue. However, the selection of the user-generated content (UGC) is
biased caused by knowledge limitations and historical preferences among music
of each uploader. In this paper, we propose a Debiased Cross-Modal (DebCM)
matching model to alleviate the influence of such selection bias. Specifically,
we design a teacher-student network to utilize the matching of segments of
music videos, which is professional-generated content (PGC) with specialized
music-matching techniques, to better alleviate the bias caused by insufficient
knowledge of users. The PGC data is captured by a teacher network to guide the
matching of uploader-selected UGC data of the student network by KL-based
knowledge transfer. In addition, uploaders' personal preferences of music
genres are identified as confounders that spuriously correlate music embeddings
and background music selections, resulting in the learned recommender system to
over-recommend music from the majority groups. To resolve such confounders in
the UGC data of the student network, backdoor adjustment is utilized to
deconfound the spurious correlation between music embeddings and prediction
scores. We further utilize Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with batch-level average
as the approximations to avoid integrating the entire confounder space
calculated by the adjustment. Extensive experiments on the TT-150k-genre
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method towards the

the unimodal annotations and the unsupervised data in the CH-SIMS v2.0, the
Acoustic Visual Mixup Consistent (AV-MC) framework is proposed. The designed
modality mixup module can be regarded as an augmentation, which mixes the
acoustic and visual modalities from different videos. Through drawing
unobserved multimodal context along with the text, the model can learn to be

provided to various applications by achieving higher throughput and lower
latency. However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high
definition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced
video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more
ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands
on the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging
paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network
i.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the
end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store
and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the
base stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to
improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics,
and targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video
streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in
augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive
computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled
architecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive
survey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing
unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. A detailed review of the
state-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal
computation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of

counterfeiting of multimedia material are becoming increasingly straightforward
to perform. At the same time, sharing fake content on the web has become so
simple that malicious users can create unpleasant situations with minimal
effort. Also, forged media are getting more and more complex, with manipulated
videos that are taking the scene over still images. The multimedia forensic
community has addressed the possible threats that this situation could imply by
developing detectors that verify the authenticity of multimedia objects.
However, the vast majority of these tools only analyze one modality at a time.
This was not a problem as long as still images were considered the most widely
edited media, but now, since manipulated videos are becoming customary,
performing monomodal analyses could be reductive. Nonetheless, there is a lack
in the literature regarding multimodal detectors, mainly due to the scarsity of
datasets containing forged multimodal data to train and test the designed
algorithms. In this paper we focus on the generation of an audio-visual
deepfake dataset. First, we present a general pipeline for synthesizing speech
deepfake content from a given real or fake video, facilitating the creation of
counterfeit multimodal material. The proposed method uses Text-to-Speech (TTS)
and Dynamic Time Warping techniques to achieve realistic speech tracks. Then,
we use the pipeline to generate and release TIMIT-TTS, a synthetic speech
dataset containing the most cutting-edge methods in the TTS field. This can be
used as a standalone audio dataset, or combined with other state-of-the-art
sets to perform multimodal research. Finally, we present numerous experiments
to benchmark the proposed dataset in both mono and multimodal conditions,
showing the need for multimodal forensic detectors and more suitable data.",-0.17090929,0.023972712,0.107971914,C

which allows the UAV to capture images of GTs from a far distance while still
