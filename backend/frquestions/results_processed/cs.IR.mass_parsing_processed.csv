questions to increase their chance to find better results. Many recent works
and shared tasks in both NLP and IR communities have focused on identifying the
need of asking clarifying questions and methodologies of generating them. These
works assume asking clarifying questions is a safe alternative to retrieving
results. As existing conversational search models are far from perfect, it's
possible and common that they could retrieve or generate bad clarifying
questions. Asking too many clarifying questions can also drain user's patience
when the user prefers searching efficiency over correctness. Hence, these
models can get backfired and harm user's search experience because of these
risks by asking clarifying questions.
  In this work, we propose a simulation framework to simulate the risk of
asking questions in conversational search and further revise a risk-aware
conversational search model to control the risk. We show the model's robustness
and effectiveness through extensive experiments on three conversations
datasets, including MSDialog, Ubuntu Dialog Corpus, and Opendialkg in which we
compare it with multiple baselines. We show that the risk-control module can
work with two different re-ranker models and outperform all the baselines in
most of our experiments.",-0.109171025,-0.26908997,-0.26162708,A

However, noisy data collected from diverse sources may damage the completion

Specifically, we introduce a graph neural network with a holistic scoring

value alignment networks to resolve the heterogeneity between values and map
them to entities even outside the KG. Furthermore, we present a truth inference
model that incorporates data source qualities into the fact scoring function,

items for a given query item. Existing CIRS models consider the item
co-purchase signal as a proxy of the complementary relationship due to the lack
of human-curated labels from the huge transaction records. These methods
represent items in a complementary embedding space and model the complementary
relationship as a point estimation of the similarity between items vectors.
However, co-purchased items are not necessarily complementary to each other.
For example, customers may frequently purchase bananas and bottled water within
the same transaction, but these two items are not complementary. Hence, using
co-purchase signals directly as labels will aggravate the model performance. On
the other hand, the model evaluation will not be trustworthy if the labels for
evaluation are not reflecting the true complementary relatedness. To address
the above challenges from noisy labeling of the copurchase data, we model the
co-purchases of two items as a Gaussian distribution, where the mean denotes
the co-purchases from the complementary relatedness, and covariance denotes the
co-purchases from the noise. To do so, we represent each item as a Gaussian
embedding and parameterize the Gaussian distribution of co-purchases by the
means and covariances from item Gaussian embedding. To reduce the impact of the
noisy labels during evaluation, we propose an independence test-based method to
generate a trustworthy label set with certain confidence. Our extensive
experiments on both the publicly available dataset and the large-scale
real-world dataset justify the effectiveness of our proposed model in
complementary item recommendations compared with the state-of-the-art models.",-0.10427348,-0.18518686,-0.101634875,A

effective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over
items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the
influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph
collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods
typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the
neighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the
potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above
issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named
Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly
incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we
introduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and
semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction
graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users
(or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In
implementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors
correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the
potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with
similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate
these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed
NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph
collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17%
performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on
the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively. Our code is available at:

that, since the ground truth retrieval effectiveness for QPP evaluation can be

systems when ordered by the QPP metric scores. Our experiments reveal that the
observed QPP outcomes can vary considerably, both in terms of the absolute

help users better understand the recommended items, increase the system's ease
of use, and gain users' trust. A typical approach to realize it is natural
language generation. However, previous works mostly adopt recurrent neural
networks to meet the ends, leaving the potentially more effective pre-trained
Transformer models under-explored. In fact, user and item IDs, as important
identifiers in recommender systems, are inherently in different semantic space
as words that pre-trained models were already trained on. Thus, how to
effectively fuse IDs into such models becomes a critical issue. Inspired by
recent advancement in prompt learning, we come up with two solutions: find
alternative words to represent IDs (called discrete prompt learning), and
directly input ID vectors to a pre-trained model (termed continuous prompt
learning). In the latter case, ID vectors are randomly initialized but the
model is trained in advance on large corpora, so they are actually in different
learning stages. To bridge the gap, we further propose two training strategies:
sequential tuning and recommendation as regularization. Extensive experiments
show that our continuous prompt learning approach equipped with the training
strategies consistently outperforms strong baselines on three datasets of

recommendation. However, since there is no manually annotated label for user

learning framework to disentangle Long and Short-term interests for
Recommendation (CLSR) with self-supervision. Specifically, we first propose two
separate encoders to independently capture user interests of different time
scales. We then extract long-term and short-term interests proxies from the
interaction sequences, which serve as pseudo labels for user interests. Then
pairwise contrastive tasks are designed to supervise the similarity between
interest representations and their corresponding interest proxies. Finally,
since the importance of long-term and short-term interests is dynamically
changing, we propose to adaptively aggregate them through an attention-based
network for prediction. We conduct experiments on two large-scale real-world
datasets for e-commerce and short-video recommendation. Empirical results show
that our CLSR consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models with
significant improvements: GAUC is improved by over 0.01, and NDCG is improved
by over 4%. Further counterfactual evaluations demonstrate that stronger
disentanglement of long and short-term interests is successfully achieved by

techniques in recommendation systems. In recent years, Graph Neural Network

achieved tremendous success and significantly advanced the state-of-the-art.
While there is a rich literature of such works using advanced models for
learning user and item representations separately, item recommendation is
essentially a link prediction problem between users and items. Furthermore,
while there have been early works employing link prediction for collaborative
filtering [5, 6], this trend has largely given way to works focused on
aggregating information from user and item nodes, rather than modeling links
directly. In this paper, we propose a new linkage (connectivity) score for
bipartite graphs, generalizing multiple standard link prediction methods. We
combine this new score with an iterative degree update process in the user-item
interaction bipartite graph to exploit local graph structures without any node
modeling. The result is a simple, non-deep learning model with only six
learnable parameters. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN-based CF approaches on
four widely used benchmarks. In particular, on Amazon-Book, we demonstrate an
over 60% improvement for both Recall and NDCG. We hope our work would invite
the community to revisit the link prediction aspect of collaborative filtering,

that contain typos. We show that a small character level perturbation in
queries (as caused by typos) highly impacts the effectiveness of dense
retrievers. We then demonstrate that the root cause of this resides in the
input tokenization strategy employed by BERT. In BERT, tokenization is
performed using the BERT's WordPiece tokenizer and we show that a token with a
typo will significantly change the token distributions obtained after
tokenization. This distribution change translates to changes in the input
embeddings passed to the BERT-based query encoder of dense retrievers. We then
turn our attention to devising dense retriever methods that are robust to such
queries with typos, while still being as performant as previous methods on
queries without typos. For this, we use CharacterBERT as the backbone encoder
and an efficient yet effective training method, called Self-Teaching (ST), that
distills knowledge from queries without typos into the queries with typos.

aggregating multiple objectives into one final objective to satisfy user demand
and commercial intent. Cascade architecture, composed of retrieval,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages, is usually adopted to reduce the computational
cost. Each stage may employ various models for different objectives and
calculate the final objective by aggregating these models' outputs. The
multi-stage ranking strategy causes a new problem - the ranked lists of the
ranking stage and previous stages may be inconsistent. For example, items that
should be ranked at the top of the ranking stage may be ranked at the bottom of
previous stages. In this paper, we focus on the ranking consistency between the
pre-ranking and ranking stages. Specifically, we formally define the problem of
ranking consistency and propose the Ranking Consistency Score (RCS) metric for
evaluation. We demonstrate that ranking consistency has a direct impact on
online performance. Compared with the traditional evaluation manner that mainly
focuses on the individual ranking quality of every objective, RCS considers the
ranking consistency of the fused final objective, which is more proper for
evaluation. Finally, to improve the ranking consistency, we propose several
methods from the perspective of sample selection and learning algorithms.
Experimental results on industrial datasets validate the efficacy of the
proposed metrics and methods. The proposed consistency methods have been

retrieve documents that are relevant for the analysis from large corpora of
otherwise irrelevant documents. The conventional approach in social science to
address this retrieval task is to apply a set of keywords and to consider those
documents to be relevant that contain at least one of the keywords. But the
application of incomplete keyword lists risks drawing biased inferences. More
complex and costly methods such as query expansion techniques, topic
model-based classification rules, and active as well as passive supervised
learning could have the potential to more accurately separate relevant from
irrelevant documents and thereby reduce the potential size of bias. Yet,
whether applying these more expensive approaches increases retrieval
performance compared to keyword lists at all, and if so, by how much, is
unclear as a comparison of these approaches is lacking. This study closes this
gap by comparing these methods across three retrieval tasks associated with a
data set of German tweets (Linder, 2017), the Social Bias Inference Corpus
(SBIC) (Sap et al., 2020), and the Reuters-21578 corpus (Lewis, 1997). Results
show that query expansion techniques and topic model-based classification rules
in most studied settings tend to decrease rather than increase retrieval
performance. Active supervised learning, however, if applied on a not too small
set of labeled training instances (e.g. 1,000 documents), reaches a
substantially higher retrieval performance than keyword lists.",-0.02900602,0.14837107,0.00792528,C

certain user group, defined based on users' activity level. Typical solutions

applied to many real-world settings, such as product bundle recommendation,
music playlist recommendation and travel package recommendation. However,
compared to studies of bundle recommendation approaches in areas such as online
shopping and digital music services, research on meal recommendations for
restaurants in the hospitality industry has made limited progress, due largely
to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets. A publicly available dataset
specialising in meal recommendation research for the research community is in
urgent demand. In this paper, we introduce a meal recommendation dataset
(MealRec) that aims to facilitate future research. MealRec is constructed from
the user review records of Allrecipe.com, covering 1,500+ users, 7,200+ recipes
and 3,800+ meals. Each recipe is described with rich information, such as
ingredients, instructions, pictures, category and tags, etc; and each meal is
three-course, consisting of an appetizer, a main dish and a dessert.

is evaluated through comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art

interactions to alleviate the data sparsity problem faced by the traditional
models that often utilize only one type of interaction for recommendation. In
real scenarios, users often take a sequence of actions to interact with an
item, in order to get more information about the item and thus accurately
evaluate whether an item fits personal preference. Those interaction behaviors
often obey a certain order, and different behaviors reveal different
information or aspects of user preferences towards the target item. Most
existing multi-behavior recommendation methods take the strategy to first
extract information from different behaviors separately and then fuse them for
final prediction. However, they have not exploited the connections between
different behaviors to learn user preferences. Besides, they often introduce
complex model structures and more parameters to model multiple behaviors,
largely increasing the space and time complexity. In this work, we propose a
lightweight multi-behavior recommendation model named Cascading Residual Graph
Convolutional Network (CRGCN for short), which can explicitly exploit the
connections between different behaviors into the embedding learning process
without introducing any additional parameters. In particular, we design a
cascading residual graph convolutional network structure, which enables our
model to learn user preferences by continuously refining user embeddings across
different types of behaviors. The multi-task learning method is adopted to
jointly optimize our model based on different behaviors. Extensive experimental
results on two real-world benchmark datasets show that CRGCN can substantially
outperform state-of-the-art methods. Further studies also analyze the effects
of leveraging multi-behaviors in different numbers and orders on the final
performance.",0.0998924,-0.39192003,0.08594732,A

entire item corpus when a user query requests, with the representative
two-tower model trained with the log softmax loss. For efficiently training
recommender retrievers on modern hardwares, inbatch sampling, where the items
in the mini-batch are shared as negatives to estimate the softmax function, has
attained growing interest. However, existing inbatch sampling based strategies
just correct the sampling bias of inbatch items with item frequency, being
unable to distinguish the user queries within the mini-batch and still
incurring significant bias from the softmax. In this paper, we propose a
Cache-Augmented Inbatch Importance Resampling (XIR) for training recommender
retrievers, which not only offers different negatives to user queries with
inbatch items, but also adaptively achieves a more accurate estimation of the
softmax distribution. Specifically, XIR resamples items for the given
mini-batch training pairs based on certain probabilities, where a cache with
more frequently sampled items is adopted to augment the candidate item set,
with the purpose of reusing the historical informative samples. XIR enables to
sample query-dependent negatives based on inbatch items and to capture dynamic
changes of model training, which leads to a better approximation of the softmax
and further contributes to better convergence. Finally, we conduct experiments
to validate the superior performance of the proposed XIR compared with
competitive approaches.",-0.28342363,-0.21763295,-0.13020778,A

information sufficiently. (2) The slow convergence speed of these traditional
loss functions makes the practical application of various recommendation models
difficult.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel loss function named Supervised
Personalized Ranking (SPR) Based on Prior Knowledge. The proposed method
improves the BPR loss by exploiting the prior knowledge on the interaction
history of each user or item in the raw data. Unlike BPR, instead of
constructing <user, positive item, negative item> triples, the proposed SPR
constructs <user, similar user, positive item, negative item> quadruples.
Although SPR is very simple, it is very effective. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed SPR not only achieves better recommendation performance, but
also significantly accelerates the convergence speed, resulting in a
significant reduction in the required training time.",0.08414891,-0.30755436,0.27385062,A

Advertisers are willing to pay search engines to promote their content to a
prominent position in the search result page (SERP). This raises concerns about
the search engine manipulation effect (SEME): the opinions of users can be
influenced by the way search results are presented. In this work, we
investigate the connection between SEME and sponsored content in the health
domain. We conduct a series of user studies in which participants need to
evaluate the effectiveness of different non-prescription natural remedies for
various medical conditions. We present participants SERPs with different
intentionally created biases towards certain viewpoints, with or without
sponsored content, and ask them to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment
only based on the information presented to them. We investigate two types of
sponsored content: 1. Direct marketing ads that directly market the product
without expressing an opinion about its effectiveness, and 2. Indirect
marketing ads that explicitly advocate the product's effectiveness on the
condition in the query. Our results reveal a significant difference between the
influence on users from these two ad types. Though direct marketing ads are
mostly skipped by users, they can tilt users decision making towards more
positive viewpoints. Indirect marketing ads affect both the users' examination
behaviour and their perception of the treatment's effectiveness. We further
discover that the contrast between the indirect marketing ads and the viewpoint
presented in the organic search results plays an important role in users'
decision-making. When the contrast is high, users exhibit a strong preference
towards a negative viewpoint, and when the contrast is low or none, users
exhibit preference towards a more positive viewpoint.",0.2416516,-0.14189282,-0.3113485,B

multi-modality information (eg. images and textual descriptions) is exploited
to improve the recommendation accuracy. Besides the user-item interaction
graph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (eg.
user-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations
of users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and
aggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be
prohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs.
Moreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly
sampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide
the learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational
cost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the
training process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
self-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires
neither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically,
BM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users
and items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three
multi-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by
reconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features
under both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need
for contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from
an additional target network for contrastive view generation. We show BM3
outperforms prior recommendation models on three datasets with number of nodes
ranging from 20K to 200K, while achieving a 2-9X reduction in training time.

handling machine learning tasks on graphs, bring a new approach to building
recommender systems, where the task of recommendation can be formulated as the
link prediction problem on user-item bipartite graphs. Training GNN-based
recommender systems (GNNRecSys) on large graphs incurs a large memory
footprint, easily exceeding the DRAM capacity on a typical server. Existing
solutions resort to distributed subgraph training, which is inefficient due to
the high cost of dynamically constructing subgraphs and significant redundancy
across subgraphs.
  The emerging Intel Optane persistent memory allows a single machine to have
up to 6 TB of memory at an affordable cost, thus making single-machine
GNNRecSys training feasible, which eliminates the inefficiencies in distributed
training. One major concern of using Optane for GNNRecSys is Optane's
relatively low bandwidth compared with DRAMs. This limitation can be
particularly detrimental to achieving high performance for GNNRecSys workloads
since their dominant compute kernels are sparse and memory access intensive. To
understand whether Optane is a good fit for GNNRecSys training, we perform an
in-depth characterization of GNNRecSys workloads and a comprehensive
benchmarking study. Our benchmarking results show that when properly
configured, Optane-based single-machine GNNRecSys training outperforms
distributed training by a large margin, especially when handling deep GNN

handling machine learning tasks on graphs, bring a new approach to building
recommender systems, where the task of recommendation can be formulated as the
link prediction problem on user-item bipartite graphs. Training GNN-based
recommender systems (GNNRecSys) on large graphs incurs a large memory
footprint, easily exceeding the DRAM capacity on a typical server. Existing
solutions resort to distributed subgraph training, which is inefficient due to
the high cost of dynamically constructing subgraphs and significant redundancy
across subgraphs.
  The emerging persistent memory technologies provide a significantly larger
memory capacity than DRAMs at an affordable cost, making single-machine
GNNRecSys training feasible, which eliminates the inefficiencies in distributed
training. One major concern of using persistent memory devices for GNNRecSys is
their relatively low bandwidth compared with DRAMs. This limitation can be
particularly detrimental to achieving high performance for GNNRecSys workloads
since their dominant compute kernels are sparse and memory access intensive. To
understand whether persistent memory is a good fit for GNNRecSys training, we
perform an in-depth characterization of GNNRecSys workloads and a comprehensive
analysis of their performance on a persistent memory device, namely, Intel
Optane. Based on the analysis, we provide guidance on how to configure Optane
for GNNRecSys workloads. Furthermore, we present techniques for large-batch
training to fully realize the advantages of single-machine GNNRecSys training.
Our experiment results show that with the tuned batch size and optimal system
configuration, Optane-based single-machine GNNRecSys training outperforms
distributed training by a large margin, especially when handling deep GNN

collaborative filtering (CF) with the modeling of user-item interaction graphs.
The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively
perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining
the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the
current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training
data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user
preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is
often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal
representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT,
a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments
user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an
explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to
maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph
transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative
self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the
user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender
systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve
the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation
studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation
framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues. The source code

systems. Recently, dynamic graph-based methods have been studied and achieved
SOTA for recommendation, majority of which focus on user's stable long-term
preference. However, in real-world scenario, user's short-term preference
evolves over time dynamically. Although there exists sequential methods that
attempt to capture it, how to model the evolution of short-term preference with
dynamic graph-based methods has not been well-addressed yet. In particular: 1)
existing methods do not explicitly encode and capture the evolution of
short-term preference as sequential methods do; 2) simply using last few
interactions is not enough for modeling the changing trend. In this paper, we
propose Long Short-Term Preference Modeling for Continuous-Time Sequential
Recommendation (LSTSR) to capture the evolution of short-term preference under
dynamic graph. Specifically, we explicitly encode short-term preference and
optimize it via memory mechanism, which has three key operations: Message,
Aggregate and Update. Our memory mechanism can not only store one-hop
information, but also trigger with new interactions online. Extensive

parameters of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) on downstream tasks. As the
model size and the number of tasks increase greatly, such approach becomes less
feasible and prohibitively expensive. Recently, a variety of
parameter-efficient tuning methods have been proposed in natural language
processing (NLP) that only fine-tune a small number of parameters while still
attaining strong performance. Yet there has been little effort to explore
parameter-efficient tuning for IR.
  In this work, we first conduct a comprehensive study of existing
parameter-efficient tuning methods at both the retrieval and re-ranking stages.
Unlike the promising results in NLP, we find that these methods cannot achieve
comparable performance to full fine-tuning at both stages when updating less
than 1\% of the original model parameters. More importantly, we find that the
existing methods are just parameter-efficient, but not learning-efficient as
they suffer from unstable training and slow convergence. To analyze the
underlying reason, we conduct a theoretical analysis and show that the
separation of the inserted trainable modules makes the optimization difficult.
To alleviate this issue, we propose to inject additional modules alongside the
\acp{PTM} to make the original scattered modules connected. In this way, all
the trainable modules can form a pathway to smooth the loss surface and thus
help stabilize the training process. Experiments at both retrieval and
re-ranking stages show that our method outperforms existing parameter-efficient
methods significantly, and achieves comparable or even better performance over
full fine-tuning.",-0.30647808,0.09741774,0.17261913,A

including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this
low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations
offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads,
resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design
a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online
inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that
previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high,
uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory
inference speed with an acceptable accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages
evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise
sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing
evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced
mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations
for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher
ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art
search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU,
SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform
sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B
testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio

manipulate public opinion in social media sites, amplifying unfairness toward
under-represented groups or individuals in job matching services, or inferring
privacy information from recommendation results. Therefore, systems'
trustworthiness has been attracting increasing attention from various aspects
for mitigating negative impacts caused by recommender systems, so as to enhance
the public's trust towards recommender systems techniques. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of Trustworthy Recommender systems (TRec) with
a specific focus on six of the most important aspects; namely, Safety &
Robustness, Nondiscrimination & Fairness, Explainability, Privacy,
Environmental Well-being, and Accountability & Auditability. For each aspect,

directions to help achieve trustworthy recommender systems in the future.",0.3511808,-0.20927227,0.14738756,B

training, which typically exhibit high sparsity, i.e., most user-item pairs are
unobserved missing data. A standard choice is treating the missing data as
negative training samples and estimating interaction likelihood between
user-item pairs along with the observed interactions. In this way, some
potential interactions are inevitably mislabeled during training, which will
hurt the model fidelity, hindering the model to recall the mislabeled items,
especially the long-tail ones. In this work, we investigate the mislabeling
issue from a new perspective of aleatoric uncertainty, which describes the
inherent randomness of missing data. The randomness pushes us to go beyond
merely the interaction likelihood and embrace aleatoric uncertainty modeling.
Towards this end, we propose a new Aleatoric Uncertainty-aware Recommendation
(AUR) framework that consists of a new uncertainty estimator along with a
normal recommender model. According to the theory of aleatoric uncertainty, we
derive a new recommendation objective to learn the estimator. As the chance of
mislabeling reflects the potential of a pair, AUR makes recommendations
according to the uncertainty, which is demonstrated to improve the
recommendation performance of less popular items without sacrificing the
overall performance. We instantiate AUR on three representative recommender
models: Matrix Factorization (MF), LightGCN, and VAE from mainstream model

modeling heterogeneous user behaviors and capturing the relationships between

avoid extra storage overhead of the routing space, we employ a weight-slicing

leverage several solutions to solve the discrete optimization issues caused by
the router module. Thanks to them, CANet could adaptively adjust its network
architecture for each input in an end-to-end manner, in which the user
preference can be effectively captured. To evaluate our work, we conduct

systems that recommend arms (e.g., products) to agents (e.g., users). In such
platforms, a myopic agent has a natural incentive to exploit, by choosing the
best product given the current information rather than to explore various
alternatives to collect information that will be used for other agents. We
propose a novel recommender system that respects agents' incentives and enjoys
asymptotically optimal performances expressed by the regret in repeated games.
We model such an incentive-aware recommender system as a multi-agent bandit
problem in a two-sided market which is equipped with an incentive constraint
induced by agents' opportunity costs. If the opportunity costs are known to the
principal, we show that there exists an incentive-compatible recommendation
policy, which pools recommendations across a genuinely good arm and an unknown
arm via a randomized and adaptive approach. On the other hand, if the
opportunity costs are unknown to the principal, we propose a policy that
randomly pools recommendations across all arms and uses each arm's cumulative
loss as feedback for exploration. We show that both policies also satisfy an
ex-post fairness criterion, which protects agents from over-exploitation.",-0.30555913,0.14599377,-0.018613867,A

  Discussion: We describe uses of NLP/TM techniques to support increased

attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability of TM
to automate steps in the SLR process. There are significant gaps in the
application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data

Our work focused on how
laying the foundations of our evaluation methodology into the theory of
measurement can improve our knowledge and understanding of the evaluation
measures we use in IR and how it can shed light on the different types of
scales adopted by our evaluation measures; we also provided evidence, through
extensive experimentation, on the impact of the different types of scales on
the statistical analyses, as well as on the impact of departing from their
assumptions. Moreover, we investigated, for the first time in IR, the concept
of meaningfulness, i.e. the invariance of the experimental statements and
inferences you draw, and proposed it as a way to ensure more valid and
generalizabile results. Moffat's comments build on: (i) misconceptions about
the representational theory of measurement, such as what an interval scale
actually is and what axioms it has to comply with; (ii) they totally miss the
central concept of meaningfulness. Therefore, we reply to Moffat's comments by
properly framing them in the representational theory of measurement and in the
concept of meaningfulness. All in all, we can only reiterate what we said
several times: the goal of this research line is to theoretically ground our
evaluation methodology - and IR is a field where it is extremely challenging to
perform any theoretical advances - in order to aim for more robust and
generalizable inferences - something we currently lack in the field. Possibly
there are other and better ways to achieve this objective and these proposals
could emerge from an open discussion in the field and from the work of others.

be) an interval scale or whether all or none evaluation measures are interval

4.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we present our solution to overcome the drawbacks of data scarcity for top-k
recommendations in spatial mobility networks.",2022-12-25 09:34:15+00:00,Modeling Time-Series and Spatial Data for Recommendations and Other Applications,cs.IR,"['cs.IR', 'cs.LG']",[arxiv.Result.Author('Vinayak Gupta')],"With the research directions described in this thesis, we seek to address the
critical challenges in designing recommender systems that can understand the
dynamics of continuous-time event sequences. We follow a ground-up approach,
i.e., first, we address the problems that may arise due to the poor quality of
CTES data being fed into a recommender system. Later, we handle the task of
designing accurate recommender systems. To improve the quality of the CTES
data, we address a fundamental problem of overcoming missing events in temporal
sequences. Moreover, to provide accurate sequence modeling frameworks, we
design solutions for points-of-interest recommendation, i.e., models that can
handle spatial mobility data of users to various POI check-ins and recommend
candidate locations for the next check-in. Lastly, we highlight that the
capabilities of the proposed models can have applications beyond recommender
systems, and we extend their abilities to design solutions for large-scale CTES
retrieval and human activity prediction. A significant part of this thesis uses
the idea of modeling the underlying distribution of CTES via neural marked
temporal point processes (MTPP). Traditional MTPP models are stochastic
processes that utilize a fixed formulation to capture the generative mechanism
of a sequence of discrete events localized in continuous time. In contrast,
neural MTPP combine the underlying ideas from the point process literature with
modern deep learning architectures. The ability of deep-learning models as
accurate function approximators has led to a significant gain in the predictive
prowess of neural MTPP models. In this thesis, we utilize and present several
neural network-based enhancements for the current MTPP frameworks for the
aforementioned real-world applications.",0.0029655527,-0.13699502,0.24364763,A
