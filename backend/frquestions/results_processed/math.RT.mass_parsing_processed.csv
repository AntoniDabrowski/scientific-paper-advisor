introduce a new basis of the peak algebra analogous to the quasisymmetric Schur
functions, uncover a new connection between Schur $Q$-functions and
quasisymmetric Schur functions, give a representation-theoretic interpretation

much previous work in this direction, our categories are concrete: the objects
are modules over a ring, and the tensor product receives a universal bi-linear
map. Central to our constructions is a novel theory of integration on
oligomorphic groups, which could be of more general interest. Classifying the

show that $\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if it admits a generic brick,
that is, there exists a generic $\Lambda$-module $G$ with
$End_{\Lambda}(G)=k(x)$. Furthermore, we give an explicit numerical condition
for brick-infiniteness of biserial algebras: If $\Lambda$ is of rank $n$, then
$\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if there exists an infinite family of
bricks of length $d$, for some $2\leq d\leq 2n$. This also results in an
algebro-geometric realization of $\tau$-tilting finiteness of this family:
$\Lambda$ is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if $\Lambda$ is brick-discrete,
meaning that in every representation variety $mod(\Lambda, \underline{d})$,
there are only finitely many orbits of bricks.
  Our results rely on our full classification of minimal brick-infinite
biserial algebras in terms of quivers and relations. This is the modern
analogue of the recent classification of minimal representation-infinite
(special) biserial algebras, given by Ringel. In particular, we show that every
minimal brick-infinite biserial algebra is gentle and admits exactly one
generic brick. Furthermore, we describe the spectrum of such algebras, which is
very similar to that of a tame hereditary algebra. In other words,
$Brick(\Lambda)$ is the disjoint union of a unique generic brick with a
countable infinite set of bricks of finite length, and a family of bricks of

quasi-split symmetric subgroup of $G_k$ with respect to an involution
$\theta_k$ of $G_k$. The classification of such involutions is independent of
the characteristic of $k$ (provided not $2$).
  We first construct a closed subgroup scheme $\mathbf{G}^\imath$ of the
Chevalley group scheme $\mathbf{G}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$. The pair $(\mathbf{G},
\mathbf{G}^\imath)$ parameterizes symmetric pairs of the given type over any
algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq 2$, that is, the geometric
fibre of $\mathbf{G}^\imath$ becomes the reductive group $K_k \subset G_k$ over
any algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. As a
consequence, we show the coordinate ring of the group $K_k$ is spanned by the
dual $\imath$canonical basis of the corresponding $\imath$quantum group.
  We then construct a quantum Frobenius splitting for the quasi-split
$\imath$quantum group at roots of $1$. This generalizes Lusztig's quantum
Frobenius splitting for quantum groups at roots of $1$. Over a field of
positive characteristic, our quantum Frobenius splitting induces a Frobenius
splitting of the algebraic group $K_k$.
  Finally, we construct Frobenius splittings of the flag variety $G_k / B_k$
that compatibly split certain $K_k$-orbit closures over positive
characteristics. We deduce cohomological vanishings of line bundles as well as
normalities. Results apply to characteristic $0$ as well, thanks to the
existence of the scheme $\mathbf{G}^\imath$. Our construction of splittings is
