Schwarzschild black holes. We consider Hawking temperature and entropy to order
G^2 and find that the area law of black holes should be modified. We think of
Hawking radiation as tunneling and find that at certain frequency {\omega} the
radiation spectrum of black holes can be pure blackbody spectrum. Therefore, it
is possible to break down information conservation. In order to ensure
information conservation at any energy scales, we suggest that black holes
cannot release all information they have. We briefly discuss the bound on
greybody factors for Schwarzschild black holes as well. Since the modification
of horizon is very tiny, the bound on greybody factors has a very small
difference between classical metric and quantum corrected metric.",-0.009310811,0.25061816,-0.054748204,C

have enabled us to study extreme astrophysical phenomena and explore
fundamental physics. A crucial requisite for these studies is to have accurate
signal models with characteristic morphologies, which have been challenging for
many decades, and researchers are still endeavoring to incorporate important
physics. Therefore, morphology-independent methods have been developed for
identifying a signal and its reconstruction. The reconstructed signal allows us
to test the agreement between the observed signal and the waveform posterior
samples from parameter estimation. These methods model observed signals using a
nearly orthogonal wavelet basis in the frame of continuous wavelet
transformation. Here, we propose log-uniform scales to construct the wavelets,
which are are highly redundant (nonorthogonal) compared to the conventional
octave scales but more efficient for reconstructing the signals at high
frequencies. And we introduce a semi-model-dependent reconstruction method
using the posterior samples of the events, where we model the signal using
Gabor-Morlet wavelets with log-uniform scales. We demonstrate the ability to
detect deviation using a numerical simulation of an eccentric binary black hole
merger, where the signal in the data does not belong to the search template
waveform manifold. Finally, we apply this method to each binary black hole
merger event in GWTC-1. We have found that the signal produced by the GW150914
event has 96% agreement with the waveform posterior samples. As the detector
sensitivity improves and the detected population of black hole mergers grows,
we expect the proposed method will provide even stronger tests.",0.4872598,-0.08565473,-0.063257694,A

gravitational waves from postmerger oscillations of binary neutron stars. These
signals contain information about the nature of the remnant and the
high-density and out-of-equilibrium physics of the postmerger processes, which
would complement any electromagnetic signal. However, the construction of
binary neutron star postmerger waveforms is much more complicated than for
binary black holes: (i) there are theoretical uncertainties in the neutron-star
equation of state and other aspects of the high-density physics, (ii) numerical
simulations are expensive and available ones only cover a small fraction of the
parameter space with limited numerical accuracy, and (iii) it is unclear how to
parametrize the theoretical uncertainties and interpolate across parameter
space. In this work, we describe the use of a machine-learning method called a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to construct postmerger models for
hyper/massive neutron star remnant signals based on numerical-relativity
simulations. The CVAE provides a probabilistic model, which encodes
uncertainties in the training data within a set of latent parameters. We
estimate that training such a model will ultimately require $\sim 10^4$

introduction to the necessary tools to understand the framework and elaborate
on some subtleties of the minimal coupling prescription between geometry and
matter in presence of torsion and nonmetricity. Then we dedicate the central
part of the thesis to study the structure of Ricci Based gravity (RBG)
theories, which will be of later use to understand generic properties of
metric-affine theories. We begin by analysing the structure of the RBG field
equations and nontrivial aspects of their solution space. We then analyse the
abrosption spectra of some spherically symmetric solutions. Then, we show that,
if the projective symmetry in these theories is explicitly broken, then there
arise ghost degrees of freedom, and we argue that this will be a generic
feature of metric-affine gravity theories. Having done this, we analyse
metricafine theories through the EFT lens, showing how the nonmetricity tkes a
particular form in generic theories where the symmetrised Ricci tensor appears
in the action beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term. This sources effective
interactions that we use to place tight constraints to these theories. In the
third part of the thesis we present a miscelanea of works which are not so
related to the structure of RBG theories. We begin by studying a model for
spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry, namely the bumblebee model, in the
metric-affine approach. In the following chapter we generalise a conformal
invariant definition of proper time given by Perlick to the case with general
nonmetricity. Finally, we present arguments that show that the recently

constructed from a set of conformal Killing vectors and the induced metric, and
then lift them to the whole manifold. Integrability conditions are derived that
ensure this, and a constructive lifting procedure is presented. The resulting
conformal Killing tensor may be irreducible. It is shown that subdomains of
foliation slices suitable for the method are fundamental photon surfaces if
some additional photon region inequality is satisfied. Thus our procedure also
opens the way to obtain a simple general analytical expression for the boundary

subject of considerable interest over the past two years. Our review begins
with a general introduction to Lovelock's theorem, and the subject of
Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action for gravity. These areas are of fundamental
importance for understanding modified theories of gravity, and inform our
subsequent discussion of recent attempts to include the effects of a
Gauss-Bonnet term in four space-time dimensions by re-scaling the appropriate
coupling parameter. We discuss the mathematical complexities involved in
implementing this idea, and review recent attempts at constructing
well-defined, self-consistent theories that enact it. We then move on to
consider the gravitational physics that results from these theories, in the
context of black holes, cosmology, and weak-field gravity. We show that 4D

emerge in flat spacetimes, in which gravity is fully ascribed either to torsion
or to non-metricity. The latter allows a much simpler formulation of General
Relativity oblivious to the affine spacetime structure, the Coincident General
Relativity. The entropy of a black hole can be computed using the Euclidean
path integral approach, which strongly relies on the addition of boundary or
regulating terms in the standard formulation of General Relativity. A more
fundamental derivation can be performed using Wald's formula, in which the
entropy is directly related to Noether charges and is applicable to general
theories with diffeomorphism invariance. In this work we extend Wald's Noether
charge method for calculating black hole entropy to spacetimes endowed with
non-metricity. Using this method, we show that Coincident General Relativity
with an improved action principle gives the same entropy as the well-known

holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite
increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain spectral

phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This
manuscript proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all
horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the
decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is motivated
by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on
horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also
appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time
(conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are modeled from
Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by
Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality
of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program

primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB

gravitational effects and/or due to tension effects. Shell stabilization may be
achieved by modifying the gravitational properties of the background spacetime.
Thus, gravastars consist of stiff matter shells with an interior deSitter space
and an exterior Schwarzshild spacetime whose attractive gravity balances the
interior repulsive gravity of the interior deSitter spacetime leading to a
stable stiff matter shell. Similar stabilization effects may be achieved by
considering rotating shells. Here we study the stability of slowly rotating
fluid shells. We show that the angular velocity of the shell has stabilizing
properties analogous to the repulsive deSitter gravity of the interior of a
gravastar. We thus use the Israel junction conditions and the fluid equation of
state of the rotating shell to construct the dynamical equations that determine
the evolution of the rotating shell radius. These dynamical equations depend on
the parameters of the background spacetime and on the angular velocity of the
shell. Assuming a rotating interior and a Schwarzschild exterior spacetime we
show that the angular velocity of the shell has interesting stabilizing
properties on the evolution of its radius R. Thus rotating matter (or vacuum)
shells can imitate black holes while avoiding the presence of a singularity and
without the presence of an interior deSitter space.",-0.084749386,0.16321331,-0.13401349,B

models. Subsequently, we construct the shadow images of Sgr A$^{\star}$ black
hole. In particular, we constrain the parameter $\alpha=1/\lambda$ which
appears in the Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model. In the strong gravity regime we find
that the shadow radius increases with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$.
Specifically, from the S2 star observations, we find within 1$\sigma$ that the
parameter must lie between $0 \leq \alpha/M^2 \leq 6 \times 10^{-4}$.
Consequently, we used the best fit parameters to model the shadow images of Sgr
A$^{\star}$ black hole and then using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we analysed the
deflection angle for leading order expansions of the parameter $\alpha$. It is
found that within the parameter range, these observables are very close to the
Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, using the best fit parameters for the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model we show the angular diameter is consistent with recent
observations for the Sgr A$^{\star}$ black hole angular diameter $(51.8 \pm

deflection angle of light, in leading order terms, we find that the deflection
angle expressed in the ADM mass coincides with the GR, but the ADM mass in the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ gravity increases with the increase of $\alpha$ and the
overall deflection angle is expected to me greater in $f(T)$ gravity. As a

Center to constrain a black hole solution of extended teleparallel gravity
models. Subsequently, we construct the shadow images of Sgr A$^{\star}$ black
hole. In particular, we constrain the parameter $\alpha=1/\lambda$ which
appears in the Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model. In the strong gravity regime we find
that the shadow radius increases with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$.
Specifically, from the S2 star observations, we find within 1$\sigma$ that the
parameter must lie between $0 \leq \alpha/M^2 \leq 6 \times 10^{-4}$.
Consequently, we used the best fit parameters to model the shadow images of Sgr
A$^{\star}$ black hole and then using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we analysed the
deflection angle for leading order expansions of the parameter $\alpha$. It is
found that within the parameter range, these observables are very close to the
Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, using the best fit parameters for the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ model we show the angular diameter is consistent with recent
observations for the Sgr A$^{\star}$ black hole angular diameter $(51.8 \pm
2.3) \mu$arcsec and difficult to be distinguished from the GR. For the
deflection angle of light, in leading order terms, we find that the deflection
angle expressed in the ADM mass coincides with the GR, but the ADM mass in the
Born-Infeld $f(T)$ gravity increases with the increase of $\alpha$ and the
overall deflection angle is expected to me greater in $f(T)$ gravity. As a
consequence of this fact, we have shown that the electromagnetic intensity
observed in shadow images is smaller compared to GR.",0.028210957,-0.043606393,0.2083728,B

and Virgo observatories are limited to using the analytical models computed for
the systems with spins of the black holes aligned with the orbital angular
momentum of the binary. The observation of black hole binaries with precessing
spins (spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum) could provide unique
astrophysical insights into the formation of these sources; thus, it is crucial
to design a search scheme to detect compact binaries with precession spins. It
has been shown that the detection of compact binaries carrying precessing spins
is not achievable with aligned-spins template waveforms. Efforts have been made
to construct the template banks to detect the precessing binaries using the
matched filtering based detection pipelines. However, in the absence of robust
methods and huge computational requirements, the precessing searches, more or
less, still remain a challenge. This work introduces a detection scheme for the
binary black holes to classify them into aligned and precessing systems using a
convolution neural network (\CNN). We treat the detection of the $\GW$ signals
from $\BBH$ systems as a classification problem. Our architecture first
classifies data as $\GW$ signals originated from binary black holes ($\BBH$) or
noise and then it further classifies the detected $\BBH$ systems as precessing
or non-precessing (aligned/anti-aligned) systems. Our classifier with an
accuracy of $\approx$ 99\% classifies between noise and the signal and with an
accuracy of $\approx$ 91\% it classifies the detected signals into aligned and
precessing signals. We have also extended our analysis for a multi-detector

mapping between Einstein and Jordan frames where the Einstein frame universe
describes the late-time evolution of the physical universe, which is driven by
dark energy and non-relativistic matter. The Brans-Dicke theory of gravity is
considered to be the dual scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame. We show
that an Einstein frame universe, with cosmological evolution of the
$\Lambda$CDM model, always corresponds to a bouncing Jordan frame universe
governed by a Brans-Dicke theory. On the other hand, quintessence models of
dark energy with non-relativistic matter component are shown to be always dual
to a Brans-Dicke Jordan frame with a turn-around, that is, a bounce or a
collapse. The evolution of the equation of state of the quintessence field
determines whether the turn-around is a bounce or a collapse. The point of the
Jordan frame turn-around for all the cases can be tuned anywhere by choosing an
appropriate Brans-Dicke parameter. This essentially leads to an alternative
description of the late-time evolution of the physical universe, in terms of a
bouncing or collapsing Brans-Dicke universe in the Jordan frame. We further
study the stability of such conformal maps against linear perturbations. An

the light ring and the null circular orbit, in a generic black hole background.
However, for the equatorial timelike circular orbit, quite different from the
light ring case, its radius is closely dependent of the energy and angular
momentum of a test particle. This fact restricts the extension of the
topological treatment to the timelike circular orbits. In this paper, we
confirm that if we take the angular momentum as the control parameter, the
energy of the test particle does not influence the asymptotic behavior of the
constructed vector with its zero points denoting the equatorial timelike
circular orbits. As a result, a well-behaved topology to characterize the
equatorial timelike circular orbits can be constructed. Our study shows that
the total topological charge of the timelike circular orbits vanishes for a
generic black hole background, which is dependent of the energy of the
particle. Significantly it reveals that the timelike circular orbits always
come in pairs. Meanwhile, the stable and unstable timelike circular orbits have
a positive or negative winding number. Of particular interest is that the
innermost stable circular orbit corresponds to the bifurcation point of the
zero point of the constructed vector. Moreover, we also examine the case when
the particle energy acts as the control parameter. It is shown that there will
be topological phase transition when the value of the particle energy is one.

this paper, a dipole magnetic field is considered as this kind of background in

vertically rather than parallel to the background magnetic field could be more
effectively converted into an electromagnetic radiation field. In the latter

direction near a neutron star. The radius of a neutron star is about ten
kilometers, so the gravitational wave with long wavelength or low frequency may
bypass neutron stars by diffraction. For high frequency gravitational wave, the
conversion probability is proportional to the distance square as that in the
static electric or magnetic background case. The smaller the inclination angle
between the dipole field and the neutron star north pole is, the larger
magnetic amplitude will be. The term that described curved spacetime will
slightly enhance this kind of probability. We estimate that this value is about
the order of $\sim 10^{-14}- 10^{-10}$. Therefore, it is expectable that this

the observed regions and specific intensities of all emission profiles are
changed correspondingly under variations of parameters. For optically thin

paper we study the phenomenology of the generation and propagation of
nonlinearities in the ringdown of a Schwarzschild black hole, using
second-order perturbation theory. Following earlier work, we show that the
Green's function and its causal structure determines how both first-order and
second-order perturbations are generated, and hence highlight that both of
these solutions inherit analogous properties. In particular, we discuss the
sense in which both linear and quadratic quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are
generated in the vicinity of the peak of the gravitational potential barrier
(loosely referred to as the light ring). Among the second-order perturbations,
there are solutions with linear QNM frequencies (whose amplitudes are thus
renormalized from their linear values), as well as quadratic QNM frequencies
with a distinct spectrum. Moreover, we show using a WKB analysis that, in the
eikonal limit, waves generated inside the light ring propagate towards the
black hole horizon, and only waves generated outside propagate towards an
asymptotic observer. These results might be relevant for recent discussions on
the validity of perturbation theory close to the merger. Finally, we argue that
even if nonlinearities are small, quadratic QNMs may be detectable and would
likely be useful for improving ringdown models of higher angular harmonics and

branes are also of interest as tentative classical counterparts of unstable

branes associated with the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution of

four-dimensional general solution with spherical symmetry and consists of two
different classes. Through the Buchdahl transformation, the class-I and

$C^\infty$ at the Killing horizon for $n=4$ and $5$, it is $C^1$ for $n\ge 6$

singularity. For $n=4$ and $5$, the spherically symmetric class-I solution can
be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini vacuum black hole with the same
value of the mass parameter at the Killing horizon in a regular manner, namely
without a lightlike massive thin-shell. This construction allows new
configurations of an asymptotically (locally) flat black hole to emerge. If a
static perfect fluid hovers outside a vacuum black hole, its energy density is
negative. In contrast, if the dynamical region inside the event horizon of a
vacuum black hole is replaced by the class-I solution, the corresponding matter
field is an anisotropic fluid and may satisfy the null and strong energy

gravity, with some frozen degrees of freedom. We focus on the minisuperspace
reduction whith a finite number of degrees of freedom. Minisuperspaces are
treated as mechanical models, evolving in one spacetime direction. This
evolution parameter represents the orthogonal coordinate to the homogeneous
foliation of the spacetime. I investigate their classical symmetries and the
algebra of the corresponding Noether charges. After presenting the formalism
allowing us to describe the reduced models in terms of an action principle, we
discuss the condition for having an (extended) conformal symmetry. In
particular, the black hole model enlightens the subtle role of the spacelike
boundary of the homogeneous slice. The latter interplays with the conformal
symmetry, being associated with a conserved quantity from the mechanical point
of view. The absence of the infinite tower of charges, characteristic of the
full theory, is due here to a symmetry-breaking mechanism. This is made
explicit by looking at the infinite-dimensional extension of the symmetry
group. This allows to look at the equation of motion of the mechanical system
in terms of the infinite-dimensional group, who in turn has the effect of
rescaling the coupling constants of the theory. Finally, the presence of the
finite symmetry group allows defining a quantum model in terms of the
corresponding representation theory. At the level of the effective theory,
accounting for the quantum effects, the request that the symmetry is protected
provides a powerful tool to discriminate between different modifications. In

laws provides a new thermodynamic perspective on the accelerated expansion of
the universe. In this paper, we explore this connection in the context of
Tsallis entropy in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium perspectives. From an
equilibrium perspective, we derive the law of emergence by considering Tsallis
entropy as the horizon entropy from the unified first law of thermodynamics and
the Clausius relation and is found to be consistent with the earlier proposals
\cite{SHEYKHI2018118,Chen2022}. However, when one uses Tsallis entropy as the
horizon entropy, the thermal evolution of the system becomes non-equilibrium
\cite{10.1093/mnras/stab2671}, which results in the generation of additional
entropy, and the first law of thermodynamics will get modified accordingly
compared to its usual equilibrium version. We obtained the law of emergence
from this modified form of the first law of thermodynamics. The law of
emergence thus obtained have a simple form, which explains the emergence of the
universe, in terms of the rate of change of the areal volume of the horizon,
instead of the effective volume as in the equilibrium case. We have further
shown that the law of emergence also satisfies the condition of the
maximization of entropy; thus, the entropy of the universe evolves to a bounded

description of stealth solutions with a timelike scalar field profile. In the
DHOST subclass, exactly stealth solutions are known to yield perturbations
infinitely strongly coupled and thus cannot be trusted. Beyond DHOST theories
with the scordatura term, such as in ghost condensation and U-DHOST, we show
that stealth configurations cannot be realized as exact solutions but those
theories instead admit approximately stealth solutions where the deviation from
the exactly stealth configuration is controlled by the mass scale $M$ of
derivative expansion. The approximately stealth solution is time-dependent,
which can be interpreted as the black hole mass growth due to the accretion of
the scalar field. From observed astrophysical black holes, we put an upper
bound on $M$ as $\hat{c}_{\rm D1}^{1/2} M\lesssim 2\times 10^{11}$ GeV, where
$\hat{c}_{\rm D1}$ is a dimensionless parameter of order unity that
characterizes the scordatura term. As far as $M$ is sufficiently below the
upper bound, the accretion is slow and the approximately stealth solutions can
be considered as stealth at astrophysical scales for all practical purposes

Camera'), arxiv.Result.Author('S. Capozziello'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. Fatibene'), arxiv.Result.Author('A. Orizzonte')]","We investigate how the cosmological Equation of State can be used for
scrutinizing extended theories of gravity, in particular, the Palatini $f(R)$
gravity. Specifically, the approach consists, at first, in investigating the
effective Equation of State produced by a given model. Then, the inverse
problem can also be considered in view of determining which models are
compatible with a given effective Equation of State. We consider and solve some
cases and show that, for example, power-law models are (the only models)
capable of transforming barotropic Equations of State into effective barotropic
ones. Moreover, the form of Equation of State is preserved (only) for $f(R)=R$,
as expected. In this perspective, modified Equations of State are a feature
capable of distinguishing Extended Gravity with respect to General Relativity.
We also investigate quadratic and non-homogeneous effective Equations of State
showing, in particular, that they contain the Starobinsky model and other ones.",0.09625503,0.013713166,-0.123244375,A
