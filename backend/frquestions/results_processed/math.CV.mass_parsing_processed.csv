Here, we generalize this viewpoint to families of mappings in higher dimensions
that are locally uniformly continuous with respect to a given modulus of
continuity. Our main application is to the normality of families of
quasiregular mappings through a locally uniform H\""older condition. This
provides a unified framework in which to consider families of quasiregular
mappings, both recovering known results of Miniowitz, Vuorinen and others, and
yielding new results. In particular, normal quasimeromorphic mappings, Yosida
quasiregular mappings and Bloch quasiregular mappings can be viewed as classes
of quasiregular mappings which arise through consideration of various metric
spaces for the domain and range. We give several characterizations of these
classes and obtain upper bounds on the rate of growth in each class.",-0.27039984,-0.19458008,-0.10948533,A

functions in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ from holomorphic intrinsic functions of one
complex variable. This result was initially proved by Fueter and Sce for the
cases where the dimension $m$ is odd using pointwise differentiation, while the
extension to the cases where $m$ is even was proved by Qian using the
corresponding Fourier multipliers.
  In this paper, we provide an alternative description of the Fueter-Sce-Qian
theorem in terms of the generalized CK-extension. The latter characterizes
axial null solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann operator in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ in
terms of their restrictions to the real line. This leads to a one-to-one
correspondence between the space of axially monogenic functions in
$\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ and the space of analytic functions of one real variable.
  We provide explicit expressions for the Fueter-Sce-Qian map in terms of the
generalized CK-extension for both cases, $m$ even and $m$ odd. These
expressions allow for a plane wave decomposition of the Fueter-Sce-Qian map or,
more in particular, a factorization of this mapping in terms of the dual Radon
transform. In turn, this decomposition provides a new possibility for extending
the Coherent State Transform (CST) to Clifford Analysis. In particular, we
construct an axial CST defined through the Fueter-Sce-Qian mapping, and show
how it is related to the axial and slice CSTs already studied in the
literature.",-0.060153663,0.34186906,0.0058541405,C
