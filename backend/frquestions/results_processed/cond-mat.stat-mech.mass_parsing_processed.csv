sense of exhibiting random-matrix statistics of their energy level spacings,
whereas integrable systems exhibit Poissonian statistics. In this paper, we
investigate a third class: spin glasses. These systems are partially chaotic
but do not achieve full thermalization due to large free energy barriers. We
examine the level spacing statistics of a canonical infinite-range quantum spin
glass, the quantum $p$-spherical model, using an analytic path integral
approach. We find statistics consistent with a direct sum of independent random
matrices, and show that the number of such matrices is equal to the number of
distinct metastable configurations -- the exponential of the spin glass
""complexity"" as obtained from the quantum Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations.
We also consider the statistical properties of the complexity itself and
identify a set of contributions to the path integral which suggest a Poissonian
distribution for the number of metastable configurations. Our results show that
level spacing statistics can probe the ergodicity-breaking in quantum spin
glasses and provide a way to generalize the notion of spin glass complexity
beyond models with a semi-classical limit.",0.0112213325,0.008296575,-0.1307106,C

extensivity in finite-size systems, and the possibility of measurement-induced

show how these key qualitative features emerge naturally also in classical
information spreading, as long as one treats the classical many-body problem on

exponentially large classical probability distribution. Our analysis is
supported by extensive numerics on prototypical cellular automata and

also introduce a `classical entanglement entropy'. Our study sheds light on the

avoiding the use of the ideal gas equation of state explicitly. We furthermore
prove the Maxwell velocity distribution for a system of harmonic oscillators.

introduce such a framework, based on the relationship between dynamical

using the statistical mechanics of trajectories. Given a prior ensemble of
molecular trajectories produced with imperfect force field parameters, the
approach allows the optimal adaption of these parameters, such that the imposed

so, the method combines the continuum path ensemble Maximum Caliber approach
with path reweighting methods for stochastic dynamics. When multiple solutions
are found, the method selects automatically the combination that corresponds to
the smallest perturbation of the entire path ensemble, as required by the
Maximum Entropy principle. To show the validity of the approach we illustrate
the method on simple test systems undergoing rare event dynamics. Next to
simple 2D potentials we explore particle models representing molecular

the low-energy physics and local densities of states. Many-body localization,
presence or lack of thermalization and quantum chaos are examples of phenomena

contribute to the dynamics and therefore affect the system's properties.
Quantifying these contributions requires the many-body density of states
(MBDoS), a function whose calculation becomes challenging even for
non-interacting identical quantum particles due to the difficulty in
enumerating states while enforcing the exchange symmetry. In the present work,
we introduce a new approach to evaluate the MBDoS in the case of systems that
can be mapped into free fermions. The starting point of our method is the
principal component analysis of the filling matrix $F$ describing how $N$
fermions can be configured into $L$ single-particle energy levels. We show that
the many body spectrum can be expanded as a weighted sum of spectra given by
the principal components of the filling matrix. The weighting coefficients only
involve renormalized energies obtained from the single body spectrum. We
illustrate our method in two classes of problems that are mapped into spinless

parameter space. Many real-world complex systems, however, are not homogeneous.
Some elements change in time faster than others, with slower elements (usually
the most relevant) providing robustness, and faster ones being adaptive.
Structural patterns of connectivity are also typically heterogeneous,
characterized by few elements with many interactions and most elements with
only a few. Here we take a few traditionally homogeneous dynamical models and
explore their heterogeneous versions, finding evidence that heterogeneity
extends criticality. Thus, parameter fine-tuning is not necessary to reach a
phase transition and obtain the benefits of (homogeneous) criticality. Simply
adding heterogeneity can extend criticality, making the search/evolution of
complex systems faster and more reliable. Our results add theoretical support
for the ubiquitous presence of heterogeneity in physical, social, and
technological systems, as natural selection can exploit heterogeneity to evolve
complexity ""for free"". In artificial systems and biological design,
heterogeneity may also be used to extend the parameter range that allows for
criticality.",-0.20411706,0.043291144,-0.17274964,B

magnetic field and coupled to a thermal reservoir. We detail and expand our
previous work: we investigate the significance of higher-order corrections to
the classical Floquet-Magnus expansion in both the high- and low-frequency

further explore how the driven system synchronises with the applied field at
low frequencies. In line with our earlier results, we find that the
high-frequency regime is characterised by a local Floquet-Gibbs ensemble with
the reservoir acting as a nearly-reversible heatsink. At low frequencies, the
driven system rapidly enters a synchronised state, which can only be fully
described in a global picture accounting for the concurrent relaxation of the
reservoir in a fictitious magnetic field arising from the drive. We highlight
how the evolving nature of the reservoir may still be incorporated in a local

distribution centered at the origin with a mean-squared displacement that grows
like $2 D^* t$, with an effective diffusion constant that is smaller than that
of a freely diffusing particle. We examine the interplay between this
coarse-grained description and the fine structure of the density, which is
given by the Boltzmann-Gibbs factor $e^{-V(x)/k_B T}$, the latter being
non-normalizable. We explain this result and construct a theory of observables

the possibility of modeling a wide variety of realistic systems but also leads

most models where stochastic resetting is studied address the case of a finite
number of uncorrelated variables, commonly a single one, such as the position
of non-interacting random walkers. Here we overcome this limitation by framing
the process of network growth with node deletion as a stochastic resetting
problem where an arbitrarily large number of degrees of freedom are coupled and
influence each other, both in the resetting and non-resetting (growth) events.

thrives interest. The logistic map $x_{t+1}=1-a x_t^2 \in [-1,1]\;(a\in [0,2])$
is neither large, since it has only one degree of freedom, nor closed, since it
is dissipative. It exhibits, nevertheless, a peculiar time evolution of its
natural entropy, which is the additive Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon one,
$S_{BG}=-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln p_i$, for all values of $a$ for which the
Lyapunov exponent is positive, and the nonadditive one $S_q=
\frac{1-\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$ with $q=0.2445\dots$ at the edge of chaos,
where the Lyapunov exponent vanishes, $W$ being the number of windows of the
phase space partition. We numerically show that, for increasing time, the
phase-space-averaged entropy overshoots above its stationary-state value in all
cases. However, when $W\to\infty$, the overshooting gradually disappears for
the most chaotic case ($a=2$), whereas, in remarkable contrast, it appears to
monotonically diverge at the Feigenbaum point ($a=1.4011\dots$). Consequently,
the stationary-state entropy value is achieved from {\it above}, instead of
from {\it below}, as it could have been a priori expected. These results raise
the question whether the usual requirements -- large, closed, and for generic
initial conditions -- for the second principle validity might be necessary but
not sufficient.",-0.32258058,-0.16748644,-0.2569176,B

semi-infinite curve of fixed points in the four-dimensional space of the model

parameters; its endpoint corresponds to the purely isotropic regime where the
original Hwa-Kardar nonlinearity becomes irrelevant. There, one is left with a
simple advection of a passive scalar field by the external environment. The
main critical dimensions are calculated to the leading one-loop order (first
terms in the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion); some of them are appear to be exact
in all orders. They remain the same along that curve, which makes it reasonable
