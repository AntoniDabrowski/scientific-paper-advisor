to limited space in a stem cell niche. While the deterministic rate equations
predict a single non-trivial attracting steady state, the master equation
predicts extinction and transient distributions of stem cell numbers with three

unimodal distributions. In all cases, we approximate solutions to the vBD

survey dense aggregations of a variety of insects, other arthropods, and worms
from a soft matter standpoint. An aggregation can be orders of magnitude larger
than its individual organisms, consisting of tens to hundreds of thousands of
individuals, and yet functions as a coherent entity. Understanding how
aggregating organisms coordinate with one another to form a superorganism
requires an interdisciplinary approach. We discuss how the physics of the
aggregation can yield additional insights to those gained from ecological and
physiological considerations, given that the aggregating individuals exchange
information, energy, and matter continually with the environment and one
another. While the connection between animal aggregations and the physics of
non-living materials has been proposed since the early 1900s, the recent advent
of physics of behavior studies provides new insights into social interactions
governed by physical principles. Current efforts focus on eusocial insects;
however, we show that these may just be the tip of an iceberg of superorganisms
that take advantage of physical interactions and simple behavioral rules to
adapt to changing environments. By bringing attention to a wide range of
invertebrate aggregations, we wish to inspire a new generation of scientists to
explore collective dynamics and bring a deeper understanding of the physics of

deeper into the underlying probabilistic structure of a generic ABS to arrive
at modifications that allow smaller models to give accurate statistics for
larger ones. We observe that simply considering a smaller aggregate model and
scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies. We exploit the observation that in
the initial Covid spread phase, the starting infections create a family tree of
infected individuals more-or-less independent of the other trees and are
modelled well as a multi-type super-critical branching process. Further, the
relative proportions amongst the population types stabilises quickly. Soon
after, for large city population, once enough people have been infected, the
future evolution of the pandemic is closely approximated by its mean field
limit with a random starting state. We build upon these insights to develop a

small molecules being mostly broad-spectrum and non-programmable. As the
scientific knowledge of microbes progresses, the scientific community is
starting to explore entirely novel approaches to tackling antimicrobial
resistance. One of the most prominent approaches is to develop next-generation
antibiotics. In this review, we discuss three innovations of next-generation
antibiotics compared to traditional antibiotics as specificity, evolvability,
and non-immunogenicity. We present a number of potential antimicrobial agents,
including bacteriophage-based therapy, CRISPR-Cas-based antimicrobials, and
microbiome-derived antimicrobial compounds. These alternative antimicrobial
agents possess innovative properties that may overcome the inherent
shortcomings of traditional antibiotics, and some of these next-generation
antibiotics are not merely far-fetched ideas but are currently in clinical
development. We further discuss some related issues and challenges such as
infection diagnostics and regulatory frameworks that still need to be addressed
to bring these next-generation antibiotics to the antibiotic market as viable
products to combat antimicrobial resistance using a diversified set of
strategies.",0.03328106,0.013583501,-0.0727015,C

greenhouses in China. Its production heavily depends on pollination services.
Compared with artificial pollination, bee pollination can significantly improve
fruit quality and save considerable labor requirement. Multiple factors such as
bee foraging behavior, planting pattern and the spatial complexity of the
greenhouse environment interacting over time and space are major obstacles to
understanding of bee pollination dynamics. We propose a spatially-explicit
agent-based simulation model which allows users to explore how various factors
including bee foraging behavior and strawberry phenology conditions as well as
the greenhouse environment influence pollination efficiency and fruit quality.
Simulation experiments allowed us to compare pollination efficiencies in
different conditions. Especially, the cause of bee pollination advantage,
optimal bee density and bee hive location were discussed based on sensitivity
analysis. In addition, simulation results provide some insights for strawberry
planting in a greenhouse. The firmly validated open-source model is a useful
tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for strawberry pollination

range of taxa; for instance, warming leads to phenological advancements in many
plant and animal species. The influence of climate change on social and
secondary sexual traits, that are associated with fitness due to their role as
quality signals, is however unknown. Here, we use more than 5800 observations
collected on two Mediterranean blue tit subspecies (Cyanistes caeruleus
caeruleus and C.c. ogliastrae) to explore whether blue crown and yellow breast
patch colourations have changed over the past 15 years. Our data suggests that
colouration has become duller and less chromatic in both sexes. In addition, in
the Corsican C.c. ogliastrae, but not in the mainland C.c. caeruleus, the
decrease is associated with an increase in temperature at moult. Quantitative
genetic analyses do not reveal any microevolutionary change in the colour
traits along the study period, strongly suggesting that the observed change
