of quantum dissipative system. While the Liouvillian gap displays a power-law
size scaling in boundary-dissipated systems with diffusive transport, its
size-scaling relation is still not known in the presence of Anderson
localization. In this letter, we study the Liouvillian gap of various
one-dimensional quasiperiodic and disorder systems with boundary dissipation

extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model, we fit the value of $a$ and find it
coinciding pretty well with the analytical result of Lyapunov exponent $\kappa$

perturbation theory to derive $\Delta_{g}\propto e^{-L/\xi}$ analytically. The
exponential scaling relation was verified to hold true in other one-dimensional

treating the boundary-dissipation operators as a perturbation, we derive an

Liouvillian gap being proportional to the minimum of boundary densities of

explanation why the Liouvillian gap has different size scaling relation in the

extracting the associated universal information from the finite-size scaling in

artificial and biological neural circuits. Understanding how neural networks
can discover appropriate representations capable of harnessing the underlying
symmetries of their inputs is thus crucial in machine learning and
neuroscience. Convolutional neural networks, for example, were designed to
exploit translation symmetry and their capabilities triggered the first wave of
deep learning successes. However, learning convolutions directly from
translation-invariant data with a fully-connected network has so far proven
elusive. Here, we show how initially fully-connected neural networks solving a
discrimination task can learn a convolutional structure directly from their
inputs, resulting in localised, space-tiling receptive fields. These receptive
fields match the filters of a convolutional network trained on the same task.
By carefully designing data models for the visual scene, we show that the
emergence of this pattern is triggered by the non-Gaussian, higher-order local
structure of the inputs, which has long been recognised as the hallmark of
natural images. We provide an analytical and numerical characterisation of the
pattern-formation mechanism responsible for this phenomenon in a simple model
and find an unexpected link between receptive field formation and tensor
decomposition of higher-order input correlations. These results provide a new
perspective on the development of low-level feature detectors in various

In the overparameterized regime in neural networks, there exist many low-loss
solutions that fit the training data equally well. The key question is which
solution is more generalizable. Empirical studies showed a strong correlation
between flatness of the loss landscape at a solution and its generalizability,
and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial in finding the flat solutions.
To understand how SGD drives the learning system to flat solutions, we
construct a simple model whose loss landscape has a continuous set of
degenerate (or near degenerate) minima. By solving the Fokker-Planck equation
of the underlying stochastic learning dynamics, we show that due to its strong
anisotropy the SGD noise introduces an additional effective loss term that
decreases with flatness and has an overall strength that increases with the
learning rate and batch-to-batch variation. We find that the additional
landscape-dependent SGD-loss breaks the degeneracy and serves as an effective
regularization for finding flat solutions. Furthermore, a stronger SGD noise
shortens the convergence time to the flat solutions. However, we identify an
upper bound for the SGD noise beyond which the system fails to converge. Our
results not only elucidate the role of SGD for generalization they may also

Different from the previous non-reciprocal circuit implementation scheme using

components only. Besides, we achieve the non-reciprocity by proportionally
varying the parameter value of the components. By measuring the voltage
response of each site, the information of eigenstates can be mapped out. The
results show that the voltage response is always larger on one end of the
circuit no matter on which end voltage driving is applied, indicating clearly
the presence of the NHSE. Furthermore, we also simulate the interplay of NHSE
and Anderson localization (AL) when additional disorder is introduced. Upon
increasing the disorder strength, we observe the transformation from the skin
effect phase to the localized phase. In the regime of skin effect phase, the

Density Wave Theory,cond-mat.dis-nn,"['cond-mat.dis-nn', 'cond-mat.soft']","[arxiv.Result.Author('Takeshi Egami'), arxiv.Result.Author('Chae Woo Ryu')]","Elucidating the atomic structure of liquid and glass is one of the important
open questions in condensed matter physics. In the conventional bottom-up
approach one starts with focusing on an atom and the short-range order of its
neighboring atoms, and the global structure is described in terms of
overlapping local clusters of atoms as building units. However, this local
approach fails to explain the strong drive to form the medium-range order which
is distinct in nature from the short-range order. We propose an even-handed
scheme with an additional top-down approach. In the top-down approach one
starts with a high-density gas state and seeks to minimize the global potential
energy through density waves. The local bottom-up and global top-down driving
forces are not compatible, and the competition and compromise between them
result in a final structure with the medium-range order. The density waves are
pinned to atoms through the phase factors and amplitudes which reflect atomic
dynamics. This even-handed approach provides a more intuitive explanation of
the structure of simple liquid and glass and its relation to properties of
liquid, such as viscosity and fragility.",0.23190051,0.05580903,-0.4607975,C
