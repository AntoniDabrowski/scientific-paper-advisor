segments connected periodically, with each segment characterized by a constant
linear mass density. The main purpose is to provide a configuration that can
mimic the properties of photonic or phononic crystals and could be implemented
in undergraduate physics laboratories. We demonstrate that this configuration
displays frequency intervals for which wave propagation is not allowed
(frequency bandgaps), in close analogy to photonic and phononic crystals. We
discuss the behavior of these bandgaps when varying physical parameters, such
as the values of the linear mass densities, the oscillation frequency, and the
number of strings constituting the entire system. Some analogies with the
propagation of electronic waves through a crystal lattice in condensed matter
physics are also explored.",0.5399811,0.6600467,3.098976e-07,C_centroid

compressible beams have a higher buckling load than their inextensible
counterpart, a detailed analysis demnstrates that this is not necessarily the
case. The argument to arrive at this conclusion is made in terms of relatively
straightforward concepts of elasticity and structural mechanics. It is shown
that for certain classes of materials the reduced pre-buckling length is more
than compensated by a softening of the elastic response, leading to a reduction
of the Euler critical load.",0.6021069,-0.6250937,1.5180558e-07,A_centroid
