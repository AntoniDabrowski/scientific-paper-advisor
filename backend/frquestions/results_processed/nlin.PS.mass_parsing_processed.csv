sensitivity to detailed surface conditions such as the distribution of snow and

increases its reflectivity (albedo), and provides a source of meltwater for
melt ponds during summer that decrease the ice's albedo. In this paper, we
develop a simple model of pre-melt snow topography that accurately describes
snow cover of flat, undeformed Arctic sea ice on several study sites for which

generalizes the ""void model"" of Popovi\'c et al. (2018) and, as such,
accurately describes the statistics of melt pond geometry. We test this model
against detailed LiDAR measurements of the pre-melt snow topography. We show
that the model snow-depth distribution is statistically indistinguishable from
the measurements on flat ice, while small disagreement exists if the ice is
deformed. We then use this model to determine analytic expressions for the
conductive heat flux through the ice and for melt pond coverage evolution

breathers, in a nonlinear lattice consisting of elements whose contacts
alternate between strain-hardening and strain-softening. The existence,
stability, and bifurcation structure of such solutions, as well as the system
dynamics in the presence of damping and driving are studied systematically. It
is found that the linear resonant peaks in the system bend toward the frequency
gap in the presence of nonlinearity. The time-periodic solutions that lie
within the frequency gap compare well to Hamiltonian breathers if the damping
and driving are small. In the Hamiltonian limit of the problem, we use a
multiple scale analysis to derive a Nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation to
construct both acoustic and optical breathers. The latter compare very well
with the numerically obtained breathers in the Hamiltonian limit.",-0.008263947,-0.08360412,-0.37479344,B

6-kinks. The stability of all of these states is explored. For each family, we

states. We also, however, study in detail the ``upper branches'' bearing higher
numbers of kinks. In addition to computing the stationary states and analyzing
their stability within the partial differential equation model, we develop an
effective particle ordinary differential equation theory that is shown to be
