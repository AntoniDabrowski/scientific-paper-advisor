mathematical logic, and almost all of these concepts can be regarded as
developing from the Stone representation theorem. In the Stone representation
theorem, a Boolean algebra is represented as the algebra of the clopen sets of
a Stone space. And based on this, a natural connection is established between
the structure of Stone space and the semantics of propositional logic. In other
words, models of a propositional theory are represented as points in a Stone
space. This enables us to use the concepts of topology to describe many facts
in logic. In this paper, we do the same thing for the first-order logic. That
is, we organize the basic objects of semantics of first-order logic, such as
theories, models, elementary embeddings, and so on, into a kind of topological
structure defined abstractly. To be precise, this kind of structure is a kind
of enriched-topological space which we call cylindric space in this paper.

single-succedent restriction of standard sequent calculi for classical modal
logics. On the other hand, they are obtained by incorporating the
hereditariness of intuitionistic Kripke models into the classical satisfaction
clauses for modal formulas. We show that, for the considered classical logics,
