include the following factors: (i) alignment between sensor orientation and external ﬁeld,
and (ii) a correlated noise term to account for stochastic steps.","The experimental results suggest that sensor location aﬀects the emergent trajectories

influence of an axisymmetric light field was experimentally studied. The
particle under consideration has the main characteristic of carrying a light
sensor in an eccentric location. For the chosen experimental conditions, the
emerging trajectories were orbital, and, more interestingly, they presented two
preferential radial distances. A mathematical model incorporating the key
experimental components was introduced. By means of numerical simulations and
theoretical analysis, it was found that, in addition to the orbiting behavior,
the sensor location could produce trapped or diffusive behaviors. Furthermore,
the study revealed that stochastic perturbation and the eccentric location of
the sensor are responsible for inducing bistability in the orbital
trajectories, in agreement with the experimental observations.",-0.31995615,0.7454032,0.1038156,B

in diamond are rapidly moving into prominence as the workhorse of a variety of
envisaged applications, ranging from the imaging of fast-fluctuating magnetic

counterparts, near-surface ensembles suffer from charge stability issues and
reduced NV formation efficiency due to the diamond surface's role as a vacancy
sink during annealing and an electron sink afterwards. To this end, work is
ongoing to determine the best methods for producing high-quality ensembles in
this regime. Here we examine the prospects for creating such ensembles
cost-effectively by implanting nitrogen-rich type Ib diamond with electron
donors, aiming to exploit the high bulk nitrogen density to combat
surface-induced band bending in the process. This approach has previously been
successful at creating deeper ensembles, however we find that in the
near-surface regime there are fewer benefits over nitrogen implantation into
pure diamond substrates. Our results suggest that control over diamond surface
termination during annealing is key to successfully creating high-yield
near-surface NV ensembles generally, and implantation into type Ib diamond may
