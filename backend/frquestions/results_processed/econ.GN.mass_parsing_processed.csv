administration in scientific articles based on modeling partial least squares

descriptive and has three phases: a) Selection of keywords and search criteria;
(b) Search and refinement of information; c) information analysis. A method of
bibliometric review of the specific literature has been used based on the
analysis of predefined indicators and completed with a qualitative content
synthesis. Results: A total of 167 publications were analyzed, making
correlations from the year, search criteria, authors, impact factor by
quartile, and by citation variables. More outstanding scientific production
comes from Scopus under the search criteria ((pls AND sem) OR ""partial least

been a progressive growth in scientific articles with the PLS-SEM technique
from 2011 to 2020. Scopus, compared to WoS, presents a more significant number
of scientific productions with this statistical approach. The authors who
register scientific articles demonstrate a high H index; in addition, there is

intergenerational equity issues caused by Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
projects. Indeed, more PPPs mean more debt being accumulated for future
generations leading to a fiscal deficit crisis. The paper draws on how the SDR
level taken today distributes societies on the Social Welfare Function (SWF).
This is done by answering two sub-questions: (i) What is the risk of PPPs debts
being off-balance sheet? (ii) How do public policies, based on the envisaged
SDR, position society within different ethical perspectives? The answers are
obtained from a discussion of the different SDRs (applied in the UK for
examples) according to the merits of the pertinent ethical theories, namely
libertarian, egalitarian, utilitarian and Rawlsian. We find that public
policymakers can manipulate the SDR to make PPPs looking like a better option
than the traditional financing form. However, this antagonises the Value for
Money principle. We also point out that public policy is not harmonised with
ethical theories. We find that at present (in the UK), the SDR is somewhere
between weighted utilitarian and Rawlsian societies in the trade-off curve.
Alas, our study finds no evidence that the (UK) government is using a
sophisticated system to keep pace with the accumulated off-balance sheet debts.
Thus, the exact prediction of the final state is hardly made because of the
uncertainty factor. We conclude that our study hopefully provides a good
analytical framework for policymakers in order to draw on the merits of ethical
theories before initiating public policies like PPPs.",-0.1296535,-0.08641496,-0.15267015,C

The high stakes of
existential risk studies (ERS) necessitate serious scrutiny and
self-reflection. We argue that existing approaches to studying existential risk
are not yet fit for purpose, and perhaps even run the risk of increasing harm.
We highlight general challenges in ERS: accommodating value pluralism, crafting
precise definitions, developing comprehensive tools for risk assessment,
dealing with uncertainty, and accounting for the dangers associated with taking
exceptional actions to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The most influential
framework for ERS, the 'techno-utopian approach' (TUA), struggles with these
issues and has a unique set of additional problems: it unnecessarily combines
the study of longtermism and longtermist ethics with the study of extinction,
relies on a non-representative moral worldview, uses ambiguous and inadequate
definitions, fails to incorporate insights from risk assessment in relevant
fields, chooses arbitrary categorisations of risk, and advocates for dangerous
mitigation strategies. Its moral and empirical assumptions might be
particularly vulnerable to securitisation and misuse. We suggest several key
improvements: separating the study of extinction ethics (ethical implications
of extinction) and existential ethics (the ethical implications of different
societal forms), from the analysis of human extinction and global catastrophe;
drawing on the latest developments in risk assessment literature; diversifying
the field, and; democratising its policy recommendations.",-0.1615002,-0.38566193,0.06396408,C

likeliness of timely construction, whether strategic bidding may have been
involved, and other jurisdictional aspects that might have influenced the

India. Using aggregated and de-identified data from the world's largest online
social network, we (i) document new descriptive findings on the structure of
social networks and spatial mobility in India; (ii) quantify the effects of
social networks on annual migration choice; and (iii) embed these estimates in
a spatial equilibrium model to study the wage implications of increasing social
connectedness. Across millions of individuals, we find that multiple measures
of social capital are concentrated among the rich and educated and among
migrants. Across destinations, both mobility patterns and social networks are
concentrated toward richer areas. A model of migration suggests individuals are
indifferent between a 10% increase in destination wages and a 12-16% increase
in destination social networks. Accounting for networks reduces the
migration-distance relationship by 19%. In equilibrium, equalizing social
networks across locations improves average wages by 3% (24% for the bottom
wage-quartile), a larger impact than removing the marginal cost of distance. We
find evidence of an economic support mechanism, with destination economic
improvements reducing the migration-network elasticity. We also find suggestive
evidence for an emotional support mechanism from qualitative surveys among
Facebook users. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest college attendance
delivers a 20% increase in network size and diversity. Taken together, our data
suggest that - by reducing effective moving costs - increasing social
connectedness across space may have considerable economic gains.",0.14088431,0.2810571,-0.10935123,B

requisite income thresholds disproportionally disadvantage single mothers, a
reflection of the high concentration of this demographic in lower segments of
the income distribution. Second, married parents and, to a lesser extent,
single fathers, are the primary beneficiaries of the CTC program when benefits
are structured as credits rather than refunds. Third, making program benefits
more generous disproportionally reduces how many single mothers, relative to
married parents and single fathers, can claim this benefit. Fourth and finally,
increasing credit refundability can mitigate gender differences in relief
eligibility, although doing so imposes externalities of its own. Our findings

Topic Modeling could significantly reduce the time to extract information from

concerns. Our research uses Topic Modeling to extract information from

Furthermore, some respondents might prefer answering questions using their

time and the corresponding unexpected delay can have much more serious
consequences than expected or moderate delay. However, the unexpected delay due
to the unreliable aspect of travel time has received limited attention in
recent studies of the valuation of travel time variability. As a complement to
current valuation research, this paper proposes the concept of the value of
travel time unreliability (VOU), which quantifies the value that travelers
place on reducing the unreliable aspect of travel time. Methodologically, we
define the summation of all unexpected delays as the unreliability area to
quantify travel time unreliability and show that it is a key element of two
well defined measures accounting for travel time unreliability. Then, we derive
the formulations of VOU and the value of travel time reliability (VOR) in the
scheduling of a trip under uncertainty. To fully capture the reliable and
unreliable aspects of travel time, the VOR and VOU are aggregated into what we
define as the value of travel time variability (VOV). We theoretically prove
that the VOV has a diminishing marginal effect in terms of the punctuality
requirement of a traveler under a valid condition. This implies that it may be

(associated with expected delays of moderate duration) and travel time
unreliability (associated with unexpected delays of longer duration), the
contribution of this paper is to derive and quantify the value of travel time
unreliability. Extensive empirical studies show that the long tail of the
travel time distribution and corresponding unexpected delay can have much more
serious consequences than expected delay. However, unexpected delay due to
unreliability has received limited attention in previous studies of the value
of travel time variability. Methodologically, we define the summation of all
unexpected delays as the unreliability area of the travel time distribution and
show that this is captured by two existing well defined reliability for
quantifying travel time variability. We then formally derive the value of
unreliability (VOU), show that it is distinct from the more established value
of reliability (VOR), and combine the VOU and VOR in an overall VOV. We prove
theoretically that the VOV exhibits diminishing marginal benefit in terms of
the traveler punctuality requirements under a validity condition, implying that
it may be economically inefficient for travelers to blindly pursue a higher
probability of not being late. We then proceed to develop the concept of the
travel time variability ratio, which gives the implicit cost of the punctuality
requirement imposed on any given trip. Numerical examples reveal that the
travel time unreliability cost can account for more than 10% of the trip cost,

of risk aversion with respect to uncertain prices can be measured through the
context of the indirect utility function (IUF) using a lab experiment. First,
the paper introduces the main elements of the duality theory (DT) in economics.
Next, it proposes the context of IUFs as a suitable framework for measuring
price risk aversion through varying prices as opposed to varying payoffs, which
has been common practice in the mainstream of experimental economics. Indeed,
the DT in modern microeconomics indicates that the direct utility function
(DUF) and the IUF are dual to each other, implicitly suggesting that the degree
of risk aversion (or risk seeking) that a given rational subject exhibits in
the context of the DUF must be equivalent to the degree of risk aversion (or
risk seeking) elicited through the context of the IUF. This paper tests the
accuracy of this theoretical prediction through a lab experiment using a series
of relevant statistical tests. This study uses the multiple price list (MPL)
method, which has been one of the most popular sets of elicitation procedures
in experimental economics to study risk preferences in the experimental
laboratory using non-interactive settings. The key findings of this study
indicate that price risk aversion (PrRA) is statistically significantly greater
than payoff risk aversion (PaRA). Additionally, it is shown that the risk
preferences elicited under the expected utility theory (EUT) are somewhat
subject to context. Other findings imply that the risk premium (RP), as a
measure of willingness to pay for insuring an uncertain situation, is
statistically significantly greater for stochastic prices compared to that for
stochastic payoffs. These results are robust across different MPL designs and
various statistical tests that are utilized.",-0.08351684,0.040174536,-0.14816412,C

significant obstacles to achieving a rapid decarbonization of its economy.
Crucially, decarbonization disproportionately affects the communities that have
been historically, politically, and socially embedded in the nation's fossil
fuel production. However, this effect has rarely been quantified in the
literature. Using econometric estimation methods that control for unobserved
heterogeneity via two-way fixed effects, spatial effects, heterogeneous time
trends, and grouped fixed effects, we demonstrate that mine closures induce a
significant and consistent contemporaneous rise in the unemployment rate across

0.056 percentage points in a given year; this effect is amplified by a factor
of four when spatial econometric dynamics are considered. Although this
response in the unemployment rate fades within 2-3 years, it has far-reaching
effects in its immediate vicinity. Furthermore, we use cluster analysis to
build a novel typology of coal counties based on qualities that are thought to
facilitate a successful recovery in the face of local industrial decline. The
combined findings of the econometric analysis and typology point to the
importance of investing in alternative sectors in places with promising levels

preference can be modelled as optimal Bayesian inference based on noisy signals

linking trust and patience could be facilitated by the neurotransmitter

the other, it has an impact on the brain's encoding of prediction error, and
could therefore increase the perceived certainty of a neural representation of

applies smart contracts to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. The
decentralized bank is a typical DeFi application. Ideally, a decentralized bank
should be decentralized in the transaction. However, many recent studies have
found that decentralized banks have not achieved a significant degree of
decentralization. This research conducts a comparative study among mainstream
decentralized banks. We apply core-periphery network features analysis using
the transaction data from four decentralized banks, Liquity, Aave, MakerDao,
and Compound. We extract six features and compare the banks' levels of
decentralization cross-sectionally. According to the analysis results, we find
that: 1) MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in the transactions than
Aave and Liquity. 2) Although decentralized banking transactions are supposed
to be decentralized, the data show that four banks have primary external
transaction core addresses such as Huobi, Coinbase, Binance, etc. We also
discuss four design features that might affect network decentralization. Our
research contributes to the literature at the interface of decentralized
finance, financial technology (Fintech), and social network analysis and

on the example of social networks. The relevance of the chosen topic is due to
the fact that people live in the information age now, and information
technologies surround us everywhere. Because of this, social networks have
become very popular. They assist people to communicate with each other despite
of the time and distance. Social networks are also companies that operate in
order to generate income therefore their owners need to know how promising and
profitable their business is. The social networks differ from traditional
companies in this case the purpose of the research is determining the features
of social networks that affect the accuracy and adequacy of the results of
company valuation. The paper reviews the definitions of information technology,
social networks, history, types of social networks, distinguishing features
based on domestic and foreign literature. There are analyzed methods of
assessing the value of Internet companies, their characteristics and methods of
application. There is the six social networks evaluation was assessed in the
practical part of the study: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, Sina Weibo
and Vkontakte on the basis of the literature studied and the methods for
evaluating the Internet companies which recommended in it, including the method
of discounting the cash flow of the company as part of the income approach and
the multiplier method as part of a comparative approach. Based on the analysis,
the features that affect the social networks valuation are identified.",-0.10131858,-0.007397495,0.11308696,C

land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved
by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages.
We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no
global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral
climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR
subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect.
First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax
because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net
carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their
carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net
carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when
marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from
carbon exporters.",-0.13137016,-0.12428524,-0.07871689,C_centroid
