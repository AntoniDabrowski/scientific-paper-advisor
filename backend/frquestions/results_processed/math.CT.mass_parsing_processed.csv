Of course, such a correspondence induces an equivalence between the opposite
category of $\textbf{Set}$ and the category of CABA's. We extend this result by
taking multialgebras over a signature $\Sigma$, specifically those whose
non-deterministic operations cannot return the empty-set, to CABA's with their
zero element removed and a structure of $\Sigma$-algebra compatible with its
order; reciprocally, one of these ""almost Boolean"" $\Sigma$-algebras is taken
to its set of atomic elements equipped with a structure of multialgebra over
$\Sigma$. This leads to an equivalence between the category of

solution to this: given a functor F : γ → Site (now we assume morphisms in
Site to be cover-reﬂecting), we deﬁne a site γ F whose underlying category

is a covariant Grothendieck construction and further study the cohomology

of a topos Sh( γ F) interpreting it as a cohomology of γ-diagramms in C.

   Construction of sheaf theoretic cohomology on categories of the type Cγ

is an important problem, since there is even a greater variety of cohomology

theories deﬁned on functor categories (diagrams of topological spaces, G-

equivariant cohomology in particular) [H88], [S94], [GZ18] which need to

be related to each other.","Now, consid-

ering the cohomology theories deﬁned this way on C we need to extend them
over the functor category Cγ, where γ is some site.","This relations should be provided via the idea
