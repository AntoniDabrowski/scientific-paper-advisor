Arnold-Beltrami Flows on three-dimensional torii, previously introduced by one
of us, is further pursued. The idea of a Universal Classifying Group (UCG) is
improved. In particular, we construct for the first time such group for the
hexagonal lattice. Mastering the cubic and hexagonal instances, we can cover
all cases. We upgrade Beltrami flows to a special type of periodic solutions of
the NS equations, presenting the relation between the classification of these
flows with the classification of contact structures. The recent developments in
contact and symplectic geometry, considering singular contact structures, in
the framework of b-manifolds, is also reviewed and we show that the choice of
the critical surface for the b-deformation seems to be strongly related to its
group-theoretical structures. This opens directions of investigation towards a
classification of the critical surfaces or boundaries in terms of the UCG and
subgroups. Furthermore, as a result of this research programme a complete set
of MATHEMATICA Codes (for the cubic and hexagonal cases) have been produced
that are able to construct Beltrami Flows with an arbitrarily large number of
parameters and analyze their hidden symmetry structures. Indeed the main goal
is the systematic organization of the parameter space into group irreps. The
two Codes are a further result, being the unavoidable basis for further
investigations. The presented exact solutions illustrate the new conceptions
and ideas here discussed. The main message is: the more symmetric is the
Beltrami Flow, the highest the probability of an on-set of chaotic
trajectories. In various applications we need chaos on small scales and a more
orderly motion on larger ones. Merging elementary chaotic solutions with large

emergence of the shot noise appearing as a stochastic term in the neural mass

demonstrate pronounced peaks in the frequencies comparable to the mean firing

connectivity and ensemble dynamics. This relationship is notoriously difficult
to approach mathematically in natural, complex networks. In our work, we aim to
understand it in a canonical framework, using complex quadratic node dynamics,
coupled in networks which we call complex quadratic networks (CQNs).
  After previously defining extensions of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets for
networks, we currently focus on the behavior of the node-wise projections of
these sets, and on defining and analyzing the phenomena of node clustering and
synchronization. We investigate the mechanisms that lead to nodes exhibiting
identical or different Mandelbrot set. We propose that clustering is strongly
determined by the network connectivity patterns, with the geometry of these
clusters further controlled by the connection weights. We then illustrate the
concept of synchronization in an existing set of whole brain,
tractography-based networks obtained from 197 human subjects using diffusion
tensor imaging.
  Synchronization and clustering are well-studied in the context of networks of
oscillators, such as neural networks. Understanding the similarities to how
these concepts apply to CQNs contributes to our understanding of universal

$B\varphi^4$ model) is introduced in which the potential form for the values of
the field whose magnitudes are greater than $1$ is multiplied by the positive
number $B$. All features related to a single kink (antikink) solution remain
unchanged and are independent of parameter $B$. However, when a kink interacts
with an antikink in a collision, the results will significantly depend on
parameter $B$. Hence, for kink-antikink collisions, many features such as the
critical speed, output velocities for a fixed initial speed, two-bounce escape
windows, extreme values, and fractal structure in terms of parameter $B$ are
considered in detail numerically. The role of parameter $B$ in the emergence of
a nearly soliton behavior in kink-antikink collisions at some initial speed
intervals is clearly confirmed. The fractal structure in the diagrams of escape
windows is seen for the regime $B\leq 1$. However, for the regime $B >1$, this
behavior gradually becomes fuzzing and chaotic as it approaches $B = 3.3$. The
case $B = 3.3$ is obtained again as the minimum of the critical speed curve as
a function of $B$. For the regime $3.3< B \leq 10$, the chaotic behavior
gradually decreases. However, a fractal structure is never observed.
Nevertheless, it is shown that despite the fuzzing and shuffling of the escape
windows, they follow the rules of the resonant energy exchange theory.",0.77351224,-0.018289397,-0.24361086,A

systems with a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom. Our main points of
interest are the relations between the timescales of thermalization and the
timescales of chaotization; the choice of appropriate observables and the
structure of equations coupling them; identifying the classes of weakly
nonintegrable dynamics and developing tools to diagnose the properties specific
to such classes. We discuss the traditional in the field methods for
thermalization timescale computation and employ them to study the scaling the
timescale with the proximity to the integrable limit. We then elaborate on a
novel framework based on the full Lyapunov spectra computation for large
systems as a powerful tool for the characterization of weak nonintegrability.
In particular, the Lyapunov spectrum scaling offers a quantitative description
allowing us to infer the structure of the underlying network of observables.
Proximity to integrable limit is associated with the rapid growth of
thermalization timescales and, thus, potential numerical challenges. We solve
these challenges by performing numerical tests using computationally efficient
model - unitary maps. The great advantage of unitary maps for numerical
applications is time-discrete error-free evolution. We use these advantages to
perform large timescale and system size computations in extreme proximity to
the integrable limit. To demonstrate the scope of obtained results we report on
